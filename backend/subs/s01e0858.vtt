<b>...that I'm unbeatable as long as I keep my cool,
isn't that right?</b>

13:36.801 --> 13:41.011
<b>You'll drop your guard again!
You're an enemy...</b>

13:42.221 --> 13:43.601
<b>...that I can beat!</b>

13:44.221 --> 13:46.181
<b>Seems like you're shrinking...</b>

13:46.601 --> 13:49.851
<b>Oh, yeah! Time's up for Gear Four!</b>

13:50.021 --> 13:51.451
<b>Okay, I stop!</b>

13:54.151 --> 13:55.931
<b>Thank you for telling me!</b>

13:56.611 --> 13:59.741
<b>I can't use Haki for 10 minutes!</b>

13:59.741 --> 14:02.911
<b>So I have to make it as far away as possible!</b>

14:03.081 --> 14:06.121
<b>A power upgrade for a limited time, huh?</b>

14:06.121 --> 14:07.501
<b>Flowing Mochi!</b>

14:07.661 --> 14:11.381
<b>I'm not an easy contender

14:21.971 --> 14:22.971
<b>Oh, no!</b>

14:25.931 --> 14:29.981
<b>I really need 10 minutes!
Without Haki, I can't even compete against him!</b>

14:38.741 --> 14:40.741
<b>Man! I can't lose him!</b>

14:40.741 --> 14:43.241
<b>This is bad! This is really bad!</b>

14:44.781 --> 14:48.701
<b>How disappointing. It's over already?</b>

14:56.421 --> 14:58.881
<b>Oh, no!</b>

15:19.611 --> 15:21.031
<b>Power Mochi!</b>

15:59.901 --> 16:01.241
<b>Is that Brulee?!</b>

16:05.911 --> 16:09.121
<b>Help! Big Brother!</b>

16:11.581 --> 16:12.911
<b>--Help!
--You fool!</b>

16:13.081 --> 16:14.671
<b>Big Brother!</b>

16:14.671 --> 16:16.171
<b>Why were you there?!</b>

16:16.171 --> 16:17.991
<b>Wait! Straw Hat!</b>

16:21.051 --> 16:22.051
<b>Dammit!</b>

16:23.801 --> 16:24.931
<b>Brulee!</b>

16:33.351 --> 16:34.551
<b>That was close!</b>

16:35.481 --> 16:37.151
<b>Where are we?</b>

16:37.521 --> 16:39.571
<b>Thank you, Branch!</b>

16:40.941 --> 16:42.741
<b>It's Brulee!</b>

16:43.611 --> 16:46.701
<b>--Alright, Branch, I'll wait here...
--It's Brulee!</b>

16:47.111 --> 16:49.161
<b>...for a while until I regain my Haki!</b>

16:49.161 --> 16:50.831
<b>It's Brulee!</b>

17:05.221 --> 17:06.631
<b>Wh-What the...?!</b>

17:20.901 --> 17:25.571
<b>Wedding...</b>

17:25.571 --> 17:26.841
<b>Stop!</b>

17:32.831 --> 17:35.451
<b>This isn't it!</b>

17:36.831 --> 17:40.961
<b>Mama, stop! I'm running this town!</b>

17:41.131 --> 17:43.841
<b>Mama! This is Nuts Island!</b>

17:43.841 --> 17:47.591
<b>Neither the cake nor Straw Hat are here!</b>

<b>Where are you?! Straw Hat!</b>

17:53.351 --> 17:54.831
<b>Big Mom?</b>

18:03.901 --> 18:06.021
<b>You got changed.</b>

18:10.241 --> 18:11.371
<b>It's quiet...</b>

18:11.791 --> 18:13.831
<b>Unbelievably...</b>

18:16.041 --> 18:17.541
<b>All serene!</b>

18:17.711 --> 18:19.921
<b>All serene!</b>

18:20.921 --> 18:24.371
<b>But it's not gonna go smoothly like this.</b>

18:24.371 --> 18:26.841
<b>She takes pride in being

<b>we have no choice but to keep going now!</b>

18:33.011 --> 18:37.641
<b>Yeah! In any case, we must get back to

18:38.391 --> 18:39.941
<b>You're right.</b>

18:40.521 --> 18:45.281
<b>If we can't meet up with Sanji-<i>kun</i> and the others
