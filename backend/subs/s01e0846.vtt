14:33.481 --> 14:36.611
<b>Go away! No, my hands are slipping!</b>

14:51.421 --> 14:55.591
<b>You're Pedro, aren't you?
I saw you five years ago, too...</b>

15:03.801 --> 15:05.051
<b>Oopsy!</b>

15:18.441 --> 15:19.741
<b>You silly rabbit!</b>

15:23.071 --> 15:25.201
<b>Garchu!</b>

15:26.661 --> 15:28.701
<b>Stop!</b>

15:33.081 --> 15:34.631
<b>Yes!</b>

15:35.081 --> 15:36.421
<b>Big Bro Tablet!</b>

15:36.501 --> 15:38.301
<b>You'd better pay attention!</b>

15:44.891 --> 15:46.851
<b>Diable Jambe!</b>

15:52.691 --> 15:55.941
<b>Flambage Shot!</b>

16:27.091 --> 16:29.221
<b>Shark Brick Fist!</b>

16:35.231 --> 16:36.901
<b>Thanks, Jimbei!</b>

16:37.061 --> 16:40.821
<b>Don't mention it! Keep luring Zeus!</b>

16:40.981 --> 16:41.621
<b>Okay!</b>

16:42.941 --> 16:44.491
<b>It's you again...</b>

16:44.951 --> 16:46.701
<b>So persistent...</b>

16:48.681 --> 16:49.951
<b>It's not over yet!</b>

17:13.521 --> 17:17.941
<b>That idiot who lost his life
by the deadly roulette that day...</b>

17:20.191 --> 17:22.031
<b>Was his name Zepo?</b>

17:23.151 --> 17:25.691
<b>I'll let you see him in hell now!</b>

17:25.991 --> 17:27.571
<b>Die!</b>

17:45.211 --> 17:46.511
<b>You-<i>gara</i>...</b>

17:47.301 --> 17:51.131
<b>...have no right to call 
my partner an "idiot"!</b>

18:00.481 --> 18:03.191
<b>Hey, everyone! Don't get separated!</b>

18:03.591 --> 18:04.691
<b>Or we'll never see each other again!</b>

18:05.441 --> 18:06.251
<b>Okay!</b>

18:07.781 --> 18:08.781
<b>--Yeah!
--Okay!</b>

18:09.031 --> 18:10.861
<b>Luffy, stop Carrot!</b>

18:11.241 --> 18:11.741
<b>All right!</b>

18:23.541 --> 18:25.131
<b>Is everyone okay?</b>

18:25.301 --> 18:26.301
<b>Seems like it!</b>

18:26.461 --> 18:30.031
<b>Cake!</b>

18:30.761 --> 18:33.011
<b>You rats!</b>

18:33.931 --> 18:36.021
<b>The Sun guy is back!</b>

18:36.181 --> 18:37.771
<b>Go deep into the forest!</b>

18:37.931 --> 18:42.481
<b>But if we just run without a plan,
they might get ahead of us again!</b>

18:42.691 --> 18:44.141
<b>You're right...</b>

18:46.071 --> 18:48.361
<b>Oh, I have an idea!</b>

18:48.491 --> 18:53.281
<b>Listen! I'll jump up and tell you
the direction of the ship!</b>

18:53.521 --> 18:57.331
<b>That way, even if they change the landscape,
we'll be fine, right?</b>

18:57.491 --> 18:58.871
<b>Yeah, you're right!</b>

18:59.041 --> 19:00.371
<b>Okay, I'm going!</b>

19:06.751 --> 19:09.261
<b>I won't let you do it!</b>

19:10.511 --> 19:12.341
<b>Are you okay, Carrot-<i>chan</i>?</b>

19:12.511 --> 19:15.051
<b>Uh-huh, I'm okay.</b>

19:16.931 --> 19:18.311
<b>Seems like...</b>

19:18.661 --> 19:21.231
<b>...it's not gonna be that easy.</b>

19:22.941 --> 19:24.441
<b>Leave it to me!</b>

19:24.611 --> 19:28.031
<b>--Pedro, will you be okay?
--Who do you think I am?</b>

19:35.531 --> 19:36.661
<b>Awesome!</b>

<b>Karajishi!</b>

19:52.471 --> 19:53.621
<b>There it is!</b>

19:55.221 --> 19:56.181
<b>It's that way!</b>

19:57.641 --> 19:58.561
<b>Okay!</b>

19:58.721 --> 20:00.101
<b>That's our Pedro!</b>

20:00.271 --> 20:02.141
<b>I'll guide you from above!</b>

20:02.311 --> 20:04.651
<b>--Okay, let's go!
--Yeah!</b>

20:04.981 --> 20:07.111
<b>I won't let you get away!</b>

20:08.861 --> 20:09.941
<b>Duck!</b>

20:27.211 --> 20:29.091
<b>Take this!</b>

20:29.251 --> 20:30.251
<b>Watch out!</b>

20:33.261 --> 20:34.231
<b>You...!</b>

20:51.481 --> 20:52.941
<b>Is this it?</b>

20:53.111 --> 20:54.701
<b>I'll have it!</b>

20:54.861 --> 20:55.781
<b>Zeus!</b>

20:55.951 --> 20:58.351
<b>It's a delicious cloud!</b>

21:03.081 --> 21:04.001
<b>What?</b>

21:04.161 --> 21:05.501
<b>Is that...</b>

21:05.961 --> 21:07.371
<b>What is it?!</b>

<b>What is he doing?!</b>

21:26.311 --> 21:27.981
<b>Hey, Zeus!</b>

21:30.311 --> 21:32.901
<b>Sanji-<i>kun</i>! Carry me and run!</b>

21:33.071 --> 21:34.611
<b>Okay, Nami-<i>san</i>!</b>

21:34.781 --> 21:37.861
<b>Everyone, run as far as you can, too!</b>

21:37.861 --> 21:38.711
<b>--Yeah!
--Okay!</b>

21:40.751 --> 21:42.411
<b>Do you have a plan?</b>

21:42.581 --> 21:43.321
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

21:44.911 --> 21:47.161
<b>Stop!</b>

21:47.541 --> 21:50.291
<b>I'm counting on you, Zeus!</b>
