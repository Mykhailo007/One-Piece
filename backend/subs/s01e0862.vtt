14:42.181 --> 14:44.221
<b>Don't worry.</b>

14:46.311 --> 14:47.891
<b>Huh?! What the...</b>

14:47.891 --> 14:50.961
<b>She just flew up from the surface!</b>

14:53.941 --> 14:55.751
<b>Cool!</b>

14:56.021 --> 14:58.461
<b>That's not all...</b>

15:00.111 --> 15:02.221
<b>Here she comes! Shoot her down!</b>

15:02.221 --> 15:03.031
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

15:03.031 --> 15:06.931
<b>--Don't lower your guard!
--She's a fighter of Zou! She must be exceptional!</b>

15:09.701 --> 15:11.641
<b>I'll bring her down!</b>

15:13.081 --> 15:14.541
<b>What?!</b>

15:18.131 --> 15:20.321
<b>Don't hold back! Take her out!</b>

15:33.901 --> 15:36.251
<b>Damn! Shoot!</b>

15:42.151 --> 15:43.741
<b>I got you!</b>

16:09.761 --> 16:11.041
<b>Hey!</b>

16:11.041 --> 16:13.661
<b>What's going on? Chopper!</b>

16:15.101 --> 16:18.751
<b>Is she capable of that?!</b>

16:21.281 --> 16:22.881
<b>Damn little rat!</b>

16:23.321 --> 16:27.551
<b>Are you gonna stop our ships
by beating all soldiers in the fleet?!</b>

16:27.551 --> 16:32.981
<b>While you're at it, your ship will sink!
So it's no use fighting...</b>

16:35.041 --> 16:36.481
<b>The wheel?!</b>

16:37.961 --> 16:40.691
<b>S-She broke the wheel!</b>

16:40.691 --> 16:44.031
<b>Oh, no! Where is this ship going?!</b>

16:44.551 --> 16:48.181
<b>That little rat!</b>

16:58.501 --> 17:01.381
<b>Screw that little rabbit...</b>

17:04.241 --> 17:06.091
<b>Let's go, Genie!</b>

17:08.611 --> 17:12.601
<b>What can I do for you, Master?!</b>

17:12.601 --> 17:16.391
<b>That little rabbit... I'm gonna chop her up!</b>

17:18.421 --> 17:19.851
<b>I'll teach you...</b>

17:19.851 --> 17:22.571
<b>...a thing or two!</b>

17:32.561 --> 17:36.331
<b>Daifuku-<i>sama</i>! You're putting us in danger!</b>

17:37.231 --> 17:40.631
<b>Where are you aiming, Genie-<i>san</i>?</b>

17:42.151 --> 17:43.301
<b>I won't let you get away!</b>

17:43.301 --> 17:45.031
<b>Come this way!</b>

17:49.911 --> 17:51.791
<b>How aggravating!</b>

17:51.791 --> 17:54.271
<b>Genie-uine Rage Split!</b>

17:56.541 --> 17:59.631
<b>Please stop! Daifuku-<i>sama</i>!</b>

17:59.631 --> 18:01.191
<b>That little...</b>

18:03.381 --> 18:06.531
<b>That rat! She got another wheel!</b>

18:06.531 --> 18:09.701
<b>What a cunning little rabbit!</b>

18:14.351 --> 18:18.371
<b>She's jumping from one ship to another
and making them attack each other!</b>

18:18.811 --> 18:20.711
<b>That's really amazing...</b>

18:20.711 --> 18:24.741
<b>Yeah! That's awesome, right?!
She's like a little sister to me!</b>

18:24.741 --> 18:28.801
<b>When the moon cycle and the weather
are in their favor,</b>

18:28.801 --> 18:31.341
<b>they become quite strong.</b>

18:31.571 --> 18:33.721
<b>The moon cycle and the weather?</b>

18:34.031 --> 18:35.281
<b>Mm-hm...</b>

18:35.991 --> 18:42.811
<b>They say if the Minks look at the clear moon
on a full moon night,</b>

18:42.811 --> 18:48.341
<b>their wilder nature that remains
deep in their memories wakes up.</b>

18:48.841 --> 18:52.301
<b>People call their white, ferocious look...</b>

18:52.761 --> 18:56.621
<b>...Sulong, the Moon Lion!</b>

18:56.621 --> 18:57.911
<b>Sulong?!</b>

18:58.141 --> 19:03.421
<b>Their actual transformation makes them lose themselves
and attack others at random</b>

19:03.421 --> 19:05.631
<b>so it's rather troublesome.</b>

19:06.111 --> 19:09.571
<b>For others and themselves...</b>

19:09.991 --> 19:13.221
<b>For themselves? What do you mean by that?</b>

19:13.221 --> 19:19.271
<b>If the Minks can't control it,
it'll wear them out after just a single night of fighting</b>

19:19.271 --> 19:21.421
<b>and they'll die.</b>

19:21.421 --> 19:22.461
<b>What?!</b>

19:22.461 --> 19:23.651
<b>Die?!</b>

19:23.921 --> 19:29.491
<b>It's a double-edged sword...
The fighting technique could cost them their life.</b>

19:30.721 --> 19:35.911
<b>Carrot-<i>san</i>...
It's so smart of her to take away their wheels!</b>

19:38.511 --> 19:43.861
<b>Now, I'll go and back her up
before it becomes a close quarters battle!</b>

19:43.861 --> 19:47.251
<b>--Back her up?
--You're gonna fall into the sea!</b>

19:48.481 --> 19:50.781
<b>Don't worry...</b>

19:57.831 --> 20:01.391
<b>Oh, yeah! He can run on water!</b>

20:01.391 --> 20:02.691
<b>Because he's light!</b>

20:05.831 --> 20:11.341
<b>We'll leave securing the sea route ahead to them
and keep moving forward at full speed!</b>

20:11.341 --> 20:12.441
<b>--Mm-hm!
--Yeah!</b>

20:12.671 --> 20:14.971
<b>Stop!</b>

20:14.971 --> 20:16.451
<b>Bavarois-<i>sama</i>!</b>

20:17.091 --> 20:20.141
<b>We have their ship in our range!</b>

20:20.141 --> 20:23.621
<b>All right! Guys, shoot it up!</b>

20:31.191 --> 20:33.051
<b>The enemy behind us caught up?!</b>

20:34.361 --> 20:36.471
<b>Okay! I'll fight, too!</b>

21:00.181 --> 21:02.411
<b>Unstoppable Donuts.</b>

21:17.201 --> 21:20.181
<b>Haki becomes even stronger...</b>

21:20.181 --> 21:22.931
<b><i>...in the heat of actual battle.</i></b>

21:22.931 --> 21:28.751
<b><i>The more you face tough enemies,
the stronger you'll be.</i></b>

21:48.231 --> 21:49.581
<b>Power Mochi!</b>

22:11.631 --> 22:13.811
<b>I don't get it...</b>

22:13.811 --> 22:16.571
<b>The difference in power is obvious.</b>

22:17.011 --> 22:19.091
<b>Why do you wanna get up?</b>

22:20.011 --> 22:23.991
<b>You know you can't win
so why do you keep fighting?</b>

22:23.991 --> 22:25.871
<b>Shut up!</b>

22:33.231 --> 22:35.671
<b>Don't make me repeat myself!</b>

22:35.671 --> 22:36.761
<b>I...</b>

22:37.231 --> 22:39.761
<b>No, <i>you</i> stop making me repeat myself!</b>

22:40.781 --> 22:44.351
<b>There is nothing you can do to defeat me.</b>

22:50.581 --> 22:54.061
<b>I'll beat you at any cost!</b>

23:09.961 --> 23:11.671
<b><i><i>Using her Sulong power,</i></i></b>

23:11.671 --> 23:15.341
