14:08.801 --> 14:10.431
<b>Cut it out!</b>

14:10.771 --> 14:13.411
<b>Worry about yourself first!</b>

14:13.411 --> 14:15.731
<b>You're far weaker than me!</b>

14:16.021 --> 14:18.361
<b>Listen carefully, Luffy!</b>

14:19.691 --> 14:21.361
<b>I'll never die!</b>

14:24.611 --> 14:25.481
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

14:26.281 --> 14:28.711
<b>Sabo told me to take care of you, too.</b>

14:29.741 --> 14:33.121
<b>I promise that I'll never die!</b>

14:34.041 --> 14:37.171
<b>How can I leave a wimpy 
brother like you behind?</b>

14:38.001 --> 14:39.981
<b>Uh-huh! Uh-huh!</b>

14:40.291 --> 14:46.391
<b>I'm not smart so I don't quite know
what really killed Sabo yet.</b>

14:47.091 --> 14:50.651
<b>But it must be something opposed to freedom.</b>

14:51.721 --> 14:54.581
<b>Sabo died before he knew freedom.</b>

14:55.431 --> 14:58.461
<b>We exchanged that same cup of <i>sake</i>
and we're alive!</b>

14:59.771 --> 15:01.761
<b>So listen, Luffy.</b>

15:02.521 --> 15:06.831
<b>We have to live without leaving any regrets.</b>

15:07.401 --> 15:08.111
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

15:09.611 --> 15:13.881
<b>We gotta go out to sea someday...</b>

15:14.701 --> 15:18.661
<b>...and live as we like.
Freer than anyone else.</b>

15:19.081 --> 15:19.711
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

15:21.831 --> 15:25.811
<b>That means we'll make enemies of many people.</b>

15:26.631 --> 15:30.241
<b>Even the old man will become our enemy.
You gotta be willing to risk everything.</b>

15:31.551 --> 15:33.461
<b>Let's go out to sea at 17!</b>

15:34.011 --> 15:37.481
<b>And we will become... pirates!</b>

15:40.601 --> 15:42.651
<b>Let's start with finding a crew!</b>

15:42.651 --> 15:44.731
<b>I want at least 10 of them.</b>

15:45.321 --> 15:47.471
<b>And the black flag!</b>

15:48.191 --> 15:51.911
<b>Alright! Let's go!</b>

15:52.321 --> 15:53.871
<b>I'm gonna become...</b>

15:54.871 --> 15:56.721
<b>...the King of the Pirates!</b>

15:59.791 --> 16:05.841
<b>So Sabo-<i>san</i> and Ace-<i>san</i> had an 
impact on Luffy-<i>san</i>'s sailing-out.</b>

16:06.001 --> 16:09.971
<b>Isn't that nice?! He sailed out for
a never-ending adventure!</b>

16:10.131 --> 16:13.731
<b>And your brother Sabo 
who you thought was dead</b>

16:13.731 --> 16:16.101
<b>is now the No.2 of the Revolutionary Army!</b>

16:16.641 --> 16:20.311
<b>The Revolutionary Army's leader
is your father, Dragon.</b>

16:20.601 --> 16:24.111
<b>The other brother, Portgas D. Ace</b>

16:24.111 --> 16:27.691
<b>was the Whitebeard Pirates' 
2nd division commander</b>

16:28.121 --> 16:31.011
<b>and the King of the Pirates 
- Gol D. Roger's son...</b>

16:31.711 --> 16:34.741
<b>What kind of family is that?!
Too many badasses!</b>

16:34.911 --> 16:38.601
<b>Doesn't it make you feel strange 
when you think that your sworn</b>

16:38.601 --> 16:40.411
<b>brother is with your father?</b>

16:40.581 --> 16:45.921
<b>Hmmm...  I don't know
because I've never met my dad before...</b>

16:45.921 --> 16:46.841
<b>But,</b>

16:47.091 --> 16:51.131
<b>wherever I am,
it feels like I'm always connected to Sabo.</b>

17:15.911 --> 17:17.991
<b>The king of the Goa Kingdom?!</b>

17:19.971 --> 17:22.031
<b>The king of the Goa Kingdom, huh?</b>

17:22.791 --> 17:27.291
<b>It's a peaceful rural kingdom
but it's home to a number of outlaws.</b>

17:27.591 --> 17:29.251
<b>Garp is an exception.</b>

17:29.301 --> 17:33.761
<b>The leader of the Revolutionary Army - Dragon,
the Chief of Staff - Sabo,</b>

17:33.761 --> 17:36.331
<b>and the pirates - "Fire Fist" and Straw Hat.</b>

17:36.891 --> 17:39.101
<b>How interesting!</b>

17:39.311 --> 17:43.811
<b>Now, kneel at my feet, Garp!</b>

17:44.121 --> 17:46.901
<b>Get out of my way. Your face irritates me.</b>

17:48.191 --> 17:51.051
<b>His rudeness leaves me speechless!</b>

17:53.991 --> 17:56.421
<b>I'll cut to the chase, Garp.</b>

17:57.491 --> 18:00.041
<b>Give me some pull with the World Nobles!</b>

18:00.041 --> 18:03.121
<b>I wanna eventually become a Celestial Dragon.</b>

18:03.381 --> 18:05.161
<b>You wanna be a scumbag like them?</b>

18:07.581 --> 18:09.341
<b>What?!</b>

18:09.721 --> 18:13.711
<b><i>Oh, please! Did anyone hear that?!
That could get us the death penalty!</i></b>

18:14.051 --> 18:17.591
<b>Oh! I shouldn't say that. I take it back.</b>

18:19.221 --> 18:20.811
<b><i>He scares me!</i></b>

18:27.101 --> 18:29.771
<b>Are you okay-<i>jamon</i>, young man?</b>

18:29.771 --> 18:30.611
<b>What?</b>

18:30.831 --> 18:34.441
<b><i>He moved?! I thought he was a building!</i></b>

18:34.441 --> 18:39.951
<b><i>Is he a Giant? I heard they eat humans
and can melt rocks with their saliva...</i></b>

18:42.451 --> 18:45.161
<b><i>No, wait. Who are they?!</i></b>

18:45.491 --> 18:46.331
<b><i>Fangs?!</i></b>

18:46.331 --> 18:47.541
<b><i>Scales?!</i></b>

18:47.871 --> 18:50.611
<b><i><i>Look at the colors of their skin.</i></i></b>

18:50.611 --> 18:53.841
<b><i>Are they Fish-Men who are 
half-human and half-fish?!</i></b>

18:54.091 --> 18:58.591
<b><i>They're classified as fish and you'll 
get a rare disease by touching them...</i></b>

18:58.841 --> 19:01.721
<b>Don't touch me!</b>

19:07.311 --> 19:10.021
<b><i>Bondola 2, now departing.</i></b>

19:16.111 --> 19:18.701
<b>All right, take care of yourself!</b>

19:18.861 --> 19:22.601
<b>Luffy-<i>sama</i>'s grandfather-<i>sama</i>,
thank you very much.</b>

19:22.991 --> 19:24.991
<b>It was fun to travel with you.</b>

19:57.001 --> 19:58.311
<b>It's so high...</b>

19:59.071 --> 20:00.491
<b>Unbelievable...</b>

20:05.161 --> 20:07.501
<b>What's the matter-<i>jamon</i>, Shirahoshi?</b>

20:14.171 --> 20:17.781
<b>Father-<i>sama</i>... It's the sun...</b>

20:18.461 --> 20:22.301
<b>Brother-<i>sama</i>! The sun is shining so brightly!</b>

20:22.301 --> 20:23.511
<b>Yeah...</b>

20:24.511 --> 20:27.381
<b>The sky goes on forever!</b>

20:27.891 --> 20:33.081
<b>The sea is also endless
and sparkling in the sun!</b>

20:33.481 --> 20:38.441
<b>Yeah, it's really amazing! Mambo!</b>

20:40.491 --> 20:43.921
<b>I didn't know that the 
surface was so dazzling!</b>

20:44.701 --> 20:46.921
<b>What a beautiful world!</b>

20:47.541 --> 20:48.561
<b>Mm-hm.</b>

20:48.951 --> 20:53.491
<b>The Sun Tree that lights up the sea floor

20:59.211 --> 21:01.961
<b>Father-<i>sama</i>, I...</b>

21:02.511 --> 21:06.251
<b>If possible, I want to live on land!</b>

21:07.251 --> 21:13.231
<b>I want to show this world in the sun
to the people of our kingdom!</b>

21:15.941 --> 21:20.071
<b>I'll ask them.
That's what the Reverie is all about-<i>jamon</i>.</b>

<b>KAMABAKKA KINGDOM</b>

<b>Since you're fighting against the

21:28.871 --> 21:31.331
<b>do you have mixed feelings, Koala?</b>

21:32.581 --> 21:36.021
<b>About the Ryugu Kingdom 
attending the Reverie?</b>

21:36.461 --> 21:38.961
<b>No, I don't, Betty-<i>san</i>.</b>

21:38.961 --> 21:42.591
<b>It's not the World Government
that we really wanna bring down.</b>

21:43.591 --> 21:46.731
<b>It's the Celestial Dragons who rule it.</b>

21:47.531 --> 21:51.871
<b>RED LINE</b>

<b>It's really high! I'm scared!</b>

<b>It's very windy! And it's shaking!</b>

22:06.451 --> 22:08.121
<b>Be quiet.</b>

22:08.321 --> 22:11.271
<b>D-D-Did you just see that?!</b>

22:11.271 --> 22:13.191
<b>What did you see?</b>

22:13.191 --> 22:17.311
<b>There was a G-Giant in the wall,
staring at us!</b>

22:17.311 --> 22:20.231
<b>H-H-He had a trident!</b>

22:20.231 --> 22:22.261
<b>You must be hallucinating...</b>

22:22.261 --> 22:24.601
<b>Can't you see how high we're at now?</b>

22:24.601 --> 22:26.641
<b>It was really there!</b>

22:29.101 --> 22:33.431
<b>--Look over there! They're crows!
--They don't usually come up this high.</b>

22:37.231 --> 22:40.121
<b>Those are the birds that 
everyone was talking about?</b>

22:40.121 --> 22:41.731
<b>They're flying!</b>

22:41.901 --> 22:45.741
<b>If they peck at the bubble, we're gonna fall!</b>

22:46.131 --> 22:48.531
<b>Hey, guard! Pull out your gun!</b>

22:48.861 --> 22:52.491
<b>Shoot down the crows!
