07:08.911 --> 07:10.411

07:12.041 --> 07:14.421
<b>What you ate was the Gum-Gum Fruit!</b>

07:14.421 --> 07:18.841
<b>The Gum-Gum Fruit is known as a Devil Fruit!

07:26.851 --> 07:28.511
<b>You dumbass!</b>

07:35.181 --> 07:39.821

16:00.481 --> 16:02.231
<b>Don't throw it away!</b>

16:02.231 --> 16:05.191
