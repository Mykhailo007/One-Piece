<b>So why do people have to die
when it's all Crocodile's fault?!</b>

12:20.571 --> 12:24.201
<b>Then why are <i>you</i> putting 
<i>your</i> life on the line?!</b>

12:24.201 --> 12:27.451
<b>--Whoa, Luffy! You're going too far!
--Damn it, Luffy!</b>

12:30.541 --> 12:35.331
<b>Just one look at this kingdom and even <i>I</i> can tell
what most needs to be done!</b>

12:35.331 --> 12:37.171
<b>What is it?!</b>

12:37.381 --> 12:41.011
<b>As if putting your single 
life on the line is enough!</b>

12:41.011 --> 12:44.681
<b>Then what <i>should</i> I be putting on the line?!</b>

12:45.761 --> 12:49.141
<b>I don't have anything else 
that I <i>can</i> put on the line...</b>

12:49.531 --> 12:53.141
<b>At least try putting all of our 
lives on the line together!</b>

12:53.141 --> 12:55.311
<b>Aren't we friends?!</b>

13:23.591 --> 13:30.411
<b><i>The Straw Hats and Vivi headed for Alubarna, 
the capital city, to stop the civil war,</i></b>

13:35.941 --> 13:37.731
<b>Sables!!</b>

13:48.321 --> 13:50.851
<b>Who do you think I am?</b>

13:51.661 --> 13:56.641
<b>There are any number of rookies like you,

<b><i><i>Meanwhile, the Straw Hats fought the members</i></i></b>

16:21.441 --> 16:24.941
<b>You can't save this country.</b>

17:02.291 --> 17:05.001
<b>She tells others not to die...</b>

17:05.001 --> 17:09.151
<b>but she's the first to lay down her own life

17:09.821 --> 17:12.111
<b>If we don't help her, she'll die.</b>

17:12.611 --> 17:14.531
<b>You guys will kill her.</b>

17:14.791 --> 17:17.281
<b>You're so dense.</b>

17:17.281 --> 17:21.001
<b>That's why I'm telling you
that you can just ditch that burden...!</b>

17:21.791 --> 17:25.711
<b>We don't want her to die!

<b><i>However, the Straw Hats

19:17.611 --> 19:20.201

20:16.751 --> 20:19.971
<b>I can't... go with you!</b>

20:19.971 --> 20:22.601
<b><i>Thank you so much for everything!</i></b>

<b>They don't like to be seen as heroes...</b>

<b>And because of their bounties and people's talk,
they keep gaining notoriety,</b>

21:26.431 --> 21:29.461
