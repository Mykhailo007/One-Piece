<b>So lovely! So lovely!</b>

17:19.781 --> 17:20.731
<b>Pudding, get it together!</b>

17:26.071 --> 17:27.661
<b>Oh, no! Mama's coming!</b>

17:28.061 --> 17:28.861
<b>Mama!</b>

17:29.031 --> 17:32.201
<b>We have no time!
Pudding, get right to the point!</b>

17:32.201 --> 17:33.081
<b>Okay!</b>

17:35.871 --> 17:37.331
<b><i>Sanji-</i>san<i>...</i></b>

17:37.961 --> 17:38.921
<b>Pudding-<i>chan</i>...</b>

17:40.461 --> 17:44.521
<b><i>I'll save you at any price...</i></b>

17:45.761 --> 17:46.721
<b><i>Price...</i></b>

17:49.511 --> 17:50.431
<b>P...</b>

17:51.221 --> 17:51.911
<b>P...</b>

17:53.181 --> 17:53.931
<b>P...</b>

17:55.101 --> 17:58.981
<b>Pathetic! You fools!
You're not gonna make it!</b>

18:00.271 --> 18:02.131
<b>Even if you escape by ship,</b>

18:02.131 --> 18:07.281
<b>Mama will chase you to the farthest sea
and sink you to the ocean floor!</b>

18:09.201 --> 18:10.861
<b>What did you say, you bastard?!</b>

18:12.451 --> 18:15.581
<b>That is not it, Pudding!
What are you talking about?!</b>

18:15.581 --> 18:19.081
<b>You're right! You're right!
What am I saying?!</b>

18:19.251 --> 18:20.351
<b>Listen!</b>

18:20.351 --> 18:26.721
<b>Mama believes that you guys stole the wedding cake
she really wanted to eat!</b>

18:26.721 --> 18:30.181
<b>What?! We don't have a cake!</b>

18:30.351 --> 18:37.181
<b>I know! But right now, Mama would chase you
even across the water until she gets the cake!</b>

18:37.351 --> 18:41.041
<b>That's right! So, Sanji! Come here!</b>

18:41.041 --> 18:46.801
<b>Watch as your friends get killed by Mama
and go through hell!</b>

18:51.821 --> 18:54.951
<b>That is not it!
What are you talking about?!</b>

18:54.951 --> 18:57.331
<b>You're right! I wanna disappear!</b>

18:57.501 --> 19:00.711
<b>If that's what you came to say,
go away, you fools!</b>

19:00.881 --> 19:02.871
<b>Wait a minute! That wasn't it!</b>

19:03.191 --> 19:04.591
<b>Black-Leg Sanji!</b>

19:04.591 --> 19:05.511
<b>What?</b>

19:05.511 --> 19:09.211
<b>Pudding told me you're good at
making sweets, too!</b>

19:09.391 --> 19:12.641
<b>Yeah, I'm excellent at any kind of cooking!</b>

19:13.261 --> 19:16.531
<b>Okay! Then, help us bake the cake!</b>

19:16.531 --> 19:20.161
<b>We'll make the cake which is the only thing
that can stop Mama!</b>

19:20.161 --> 19:22.351
<b>And we'll help you guys escape!</b>

19:22.521 --> 19:24.271
<b>Chiffon! Why?!</b>

19:24.441 --> 19:29.691
<b>I wanna pay my debt to you for saving Lola!
And I'll risk my life to do it!</b>

19:29.861 --> 19:31.741
<b>Thank you, Chiffon!</b>

19:31.911 --> 19:32.571
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

19:32.571 --> 19:38.661
<b>Hmph! Maybe that's how we end up!
But unlike my sister, I'm not doing it for you!</b>

19:38.851 --> 19:43.891
<b>The cake that I was gonna bake for myself
happened by chance to be the one Mama craves now!</b>

19:43.891 --> 19:48.211
<b>A-A-And I just passed by here by coincidence!
I didn't know you guys were here!</b>

19:49.841 --> 19:57.371
<b>S-So it's not like I came all the way to stop her
because I didn't want you to die, Sanji...</b>

19:58.601 --> 19:59.771
<b>...<i>san</i>!</b>

20:04.101 --> 20:06.561
<b><i>Her personality is like a roller coaster!</i></b>

20:06.731 --> 20:10.731
<b>I see! That's good!
Where can we bake the cake?!</b>

20:10.911 --> 20:11.601
<b>What?</b>

20:12.741 --> 20:14.151
<b>Cho... Choco... Cho...</b>

20:14.331 --> 20:17.461
<b>We have extra supplies of the ingredients
at Chocolat Town!</b>

20:17.721 --> 20:18.971
<b>WHOLE CAKE ISLAND</b>

20:18.491 --> 20:23.481
<b>First, we'll go to Chocolat Town
and bake the cake as fast as we can!</b>

20:19.391 --> 20:28.021
<b>CHOCOLAT TOWN, CACAO ISLAND</b>

20:23.961 --> 20:28.131
<b>Then, we'll carry it on a ship
and deliver it to you!</b>

20:28.301 --> 20:32.251
<b>And we'll let Mama who comes after you
eat the cake.</b>

20:33.761 --> 20:38.341
<b>That way, we can distract her attention from you!
So hang in there until that time!</b>

20:39.141 --> 20:40.011
<b>Is she coming?!</b>

20:40.761 --> 20:42.851
<b>Wedding...</b>

20:43.481 --> 20:46.711
<b>Once you sail out to sea,
you'll have enemies in front of you, too!</b>

20:47.171 --> 20:50.021
<b>But I believe you guys can endure it!</b>

20:50.021 --> 20:50.621
<b>We will!</b>

20:51.031 --> 20:52.701
<b>Then, I'll come with you!</b>

20:52.701 --> 20:54.901
<b>--What?!
--Yeah, hop on quickly!</b>

20:55.071 --> 21:00.041
<b>W-W-Wait!
Who said you can ride it, idiot?!</b>

21:00.041 --> 21:02.051
<b>Th-There's no space!</b>

21:03.411 --> 21:05.291
<b>Don't take my place!</b>

21:05.501 --> 21:08.161
<b>Cake!</b>

21:18.221 --> 21:19.431
<b>She surfaced!</b>

21:22.011 --> 21:27.231
<b>The cake you guys will bake
is the only hope to stop Big Mom!</b>

21:27.691 --> 21:28.811
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

21:28.981 --> 21:29.781
<b>Guys!</b>

21:30.561 --> 21:33.471
<b>I'm gonna leave you for now
but I promise I'll return!</b>

21:34.261 --> 21:35.111
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

21:36.241 --> 21:37.091
<b>Okay!</b>

21:40.951 --> 21:43.301
<b>Yeah, I know you will!</b>

21:51.001 --> 21:52.151
<b>Hey!</b>

21:52.151 --> 21:53.121
<b>Pudding!</b>

21:53.561 --> 21:54.671
<b>Chiffon!</b>

21:58.301 --> 22:00.511
<b>Oh no! She's gonna do it again!</b>

22:03.681 --> 22:04.601
<b>Get away!</b>

22:06.891 --> 22:11.271
<b>What are you doing right there?!</b>

22:11.441 --> 22:13.771
<b>Luffy! See you at sea!</b>

22:13.941 --> 22:15.731
<b>I'm counting on you, Sanji!</b>

22:19.951 --> 22:21.071
<b>Ikoku Sovereignty!</b>

23:09.461 --> 23:15.161
<b><i>Katakuri and Perospero!

<b><i><i>The sweet and horrific Candyman seeps into</i></i></b>

23:17.981 --> 23:21.931
<b><i>Chopper and Brook's bodies to take their 
lives, leaving them in a desperate situation.</i></b>

23:22.111 --> 23:24.891
<b><i>Will Luffy be able to make it in time?!</i></b>

23:24.891 --> 23:26.391
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!</b>

23:26.391 --> 23:30.261
<b>"Save the Sunny! Fighting 
Bravely! Chopper and Brook!"</b>

23:30.261 --> 23:32.791
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
