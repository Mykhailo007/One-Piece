You're trying to trim all the sails on the ship single-handedly!</b>

16:17.311 --> 16:19.321
<b>Nami! How is the wind?!</b>

16:21.281 --> 16:23.691
<b>A strong wind is coming from the south!</b>

16:24.321 --> 16:25.781
<b>All right!</b>

16:25.951 --> 16:28.031
<b>What are you going to do, Jimbei?!</b>

16:34.621 --> 16:37.041
<b>I'm gonna tack the ship quickly!</b>

16:37.211 --> 16:38.541
<b>What?!</b>

16:38.711 --> 16:41.501
<b>You must be kidding! Why do you wanna
turn the ship?!</b>

16:42.631 --> 16:45.221
<b>We'll enter the Green Room!</b>

16:45.381 --> 16:48.341
<b>Here we go! Here we go!</b>

16:48.851 --> 16:50.971
<b>Give it to me!</b>

17:20.381 --> 17:23.001
<b>Green Room?! What is that?!</b>

17:23.051 --> 17:26.801
<b>Why are we heading towards the wave?!
Jimbei!</b>

17:26.971 --> 17:29.761
<b>Wedding...</b>

17:32.681 --> 17:36.521
<b>...cake!</b>

17:39.101 --> 17:43.691
<b>I see! By "Green Room," you mean "heaven"!</b>

17:43.861 --> 17:48.111
<b>Doctor! I'm finally coming to meet you!</b>

17:50.161 --> 17:54.041
<b>It's over! This is impossible! It's not surfing!</b>

17:55.451 --> 17:57.001
<b>Pedro!</b>

18:03.421 --> 18:06.761
<b>Hold on to the ship tightly!</b>

18:09.301 --> 18:12.141
<b>Splash!</b>

18:20.901 --> 18:23.521
<b>What's wrong?! What happened?!</b>

18:29.951 --> 18:32.871
<b><i>Hey, can you hear me?!</i></b>

18:32.911 --> 18:35.621
<b><i>Somebody! Say something!</i></b>

18:39.251 --> 18:40.211
<b>Huh?</b>

18:55.471 --> 18:59.561
<b>Are we in heaven? It's beautiful...</b>

18:59.731 --> 19:02.601
<b>This is a hell of a ship!</b>

19:03.271 --> 19:08.901
<b>The Green Room is a brief "wave room"
that forms inside a collapsing wave.</b>

19:09.611 --> 19:14.531
<b>To children of the Fish-Man Tribe,
it was a perfect place to play!</b>

19:15.201 --> 19:17.331
<b>Then, this space is...</b>

19:20.041 --> 19:21.831
<b>No way...</b>

19:23.711 --> 19:26.541
<b>We're inside the wave?!</b>

19:27.251 --> 19:29.961
<b>We're gonna sail through it! Hang on!</b>

19:44.481 --> 19:47.731
<b>You got a nice ship and a good navigator!</b>

19:47.771 --> 19:52.491
<b>If you can control it well, this ship is invincible!</b>

19:52.651 --> 19:58.081
<b>I can't believe it! He's controlling the sloop
like it's his own limb!</b>

19:58.451 --> 20:01.451
<b>I've never seen such a helmsman!</b>

20:01.621 --> 20:04.251
<b>You're cool, Jimbei!</b>

20:04.921 --> 20:07.881
<b>So we're not gonna die?!</b>

20:15.261 --> 20:17.051
<b>Yay!</b>

20:17.221 --> 20:19.641
<b>I thought we weren't gonna make it!</b>

20:20.681 --> 20:22.851
<b>That's impressive, Jimbei-<i>san</i>!</b>

20:23.021 --> 20:25.021
<b>Very impressive, Jimbei!</b>

20:28.691 --> 20:30.231
<b>Hm? Nami?</b>

20:36.031 --> 20:40.121
<b>Bubble, bubble... Sluggie-gie...</b>

20:42.371 --> 20:47.081
<b>Wedding...</b>

20:47.121 --> 20:49.961
<b>...cake!</b>

20:53.421 --> 20:57.841
<b>Well, who cares...
That serves those little punks right!</b>

20:58.641 --> 21:04.061
<b><i>My lie was swallowed by the sea along with their ship!</i></b>

21:04.101 --> 21:05.691
<b><i>Lick!</i></b>

21:07.651 --> 21:10.821
<b><i>This is Perospero. Hey, Katakuri.</i></b>

21:11.231 --> 21:14.031
<b><i>We took care of all of them!</i></b>

21:14.191 --> 21:15.191
<b>What?!</b>

21:15.571 --> 21:18.531
<b>Hey, Nami! Brook! Carrot!</b>

21:18.571 --> 21:20.951
<b>Chopper! Jimbei!</b>

21:21.331 --> 21:22.911
<b>Oh, no!</b>

21:22.951 --> 21:26.291
<b>We were gonna invade the ship now!</b>

21:26.331 --> 21:28.331
<b>The plan's aborted, guys!</b>

21:28.371 --> 21:32.751
<b>It seems like the ship has already
sank into the sea.</b>

21:33.131 --> 21:35.801
<b>But it's strange, Big Sis.</b>

21:35.841 --> 21:39.261
<b>The other side of the mirror
doesn't look like it's underwater.</b>

21:40.641 --> 21:41.601
<b>Look!</b>

21:41.761 --> 21:44.011
<b>No way!</b>

21:44.061 --> 21:48.891
<b>But, just to make sure, shoot one more.</b>

21:52.271 --> 21:56.111
<b>Wow! The mirror! Big Sis, it suddenly broke!</b>

21:56.281 --> 21:59.071
<b>What? What? What's going on?!</b>

22:16.131 --> 22:18.671
<b>Nami-<i>san</i>! Why did you break the mirror?!</b>

22:18.721 --> 22:22.301
<b>Luffy-<i>san</i> can't come back to the ship without it!</b>

22:23.011 --> 22:27.101
<b><i>Let me focus just on this guy!</i></b>

22:29.731 --> 22:34.521
<b>Just break them all!
All the mirrors on the ship!</b>

22:34.901 --> 22:35.731
<b>But...</b>

22:35.901 --> 22:38.691
<b>Do you wanna get in Luffy's way?!</b>

22:41.361 --> 22:44.701
<b>It's the Captain's orders! Hurry up!</b>

23:09.351 --> 23:14.651
<b><i>The barrage of Katakuri's deadly attack,
Willow Mochi, corners Luffy!</i></b>

23:14.691 --> 23:19.321
<b><i>There is only one piece of a mirror that allows Luffy and his crew
to promise to reunite.</i></b>

23:19.361 --> 23:25.371
<b><i>For his deeply-worried crew,
Captain Luffy shows his chivalrous spirit!</i></b>

23:25.531 --> 23:30.201
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Threat of the Mole! Luffy's Silent Fight!"</b>

23:30.251 --> 23:33.461
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
