<b>Oh, no!
The ship is gonna smash right into us!</b>

16:42.611 --> 16:44.111
<b>Stop!</b>

16:44.271 --> 16:46.531
<b>It's gonna crash into the bank!</b>

16:47.281 --> 16:48.861
<b>You've got to be kidding!</b>

17:13.641 --> 17:16.681
<b>It's running on the coast!</b>

17:16.851 --> 17:17.811
<b>Bege!</b>

17:17.971 --> 17:20.311
<b>Don't hold back! Get ready to shoot!</b>

17:20.481 --> 17:22.441
<b>You traitor!</b>

17:22.601 --> 17:26.691
<b>This is great!
I'll burn you along with your ship!</b>

17:28.531 --> 17:31.111
<b>Get out of my way, you little punks.</b>

17:33.821 --> 17:37.201
<b>This Nostra Castello is...</b>

17:37.241 --> 17:40.501
<b>...amphibious!</b>

18:14.611 --> 18:17.411
<b>I'm here to pick you up, Chiffon!</b>

18:17.581 --> 18:19.081
<b>Bege!</b>

18:20.201 --> 18:22.751
<b>The paddles turned into tank tracks!</b>

18:22.911 --> 18:25.791
<b>I've never heard of such a gimmick!</b>

18:25.961 --> 18:28.881
<b>Well, I've never told you!</b>

18:33.301 --> 18:37.641
<b>Why would I show my cards
to people who I plan on betraying?!</b>

18:37.801 --> 18:39.351
<b>You asshole!</b>

18:39.511 --> 18:41.641
<b>Shoot-<i>rero</i>!</b>

18:54.821 --> 18:58.031
<b><i>Chiffon! Hand the cake over to us!</i></b>

18:58.201 --> 18:59.161
<b>What?!</b>

18:59.331 --> 19:01.581
<b>It's impossible! The cake is gigantic!</b>

19:01.741 --> 19:05.501
<b>How can you hand it over
to a ship at that speed?!</b>

19:16.881 --> 19:19.471
<b>What?! Whaaat?!</b>

19:20.101 --> 19:24.231
<b>The carriage is in the air?!</b>

19:29.021 --> 19:30.561
<b>What's going on?!</b>

19:34.031 --> 19:35.611
<b>What?!</b>

19:37.411 --> 19:38.951
<b>Black-Leg!</b>

19:40.411 --> 19:42.871
<b>Make room on the deck, Bege!</b>

19:44.291 --> 19:46.291
<b><i>Sanji-</i>san<i>!</i></b>

19:50.961 --> 19:53.421
<b>Pudding-<i>sama</i>!</b>

19:54.421 --> 19:56.921
<b>Somebody, help!</b>

19:57.091 --> 19:58.261
<b>Be quiet, Branch!</b>

19:58.431 --> 19:59.551
<b>It's Brulee!</b>

19:58.431 --> 20:03.221
<b>CHIPS TOWN</b>

19:59.721 --> 20:03.221
<b><i>This is Chips Town! Straw Hat Luffy is here!</i></b>

20:04.721 --> 20:07.101
<b>Let go of me!</b>

20:04.721 --> 20:09.941
<b>MIRROWORLD</b>

20:08.271 --> 20:09.941
<b><i>This is Chockfull Town!</i></b>

20:10.481 --> 20:12.481
<b><i>Straw Hat has been spotted!</i></b>

20:12.651 --> 20:15.651
<b>What?! Chockfull Town this time?!</b>

20:14.531 --> 20:20.321
<b>SWEET CITY</b>

20:15.821 --> 20:20.321
<b><i>Straw Hat is emerging in different places!
Seems like he's running around the Mirroworld!</i></b>

20:20.491 --> 20:24.831
<b>Did Big Sis Brulee get caught again?!</b>

20:25.241 --> 20:26.951
<b><i>This is Green Town!</i></b>

20:27.001 --> 20:33.421
<b><i>We have multiple calls from private residences
saying they saw someone suspicious!</i></b>

20:40.631 --> 20:45.761
<b>What are you doing?! If you wanna escape,
why don't you go to Cacao Island already?!</b>

20:45.931 --> 20:48.021
<b>What? How do you know that?</b>

20:48.181 --> 20:51.601
<b>I eavesdropped!
Everyone knows now!</b>

20:51.771 --> 20:53.481
<b>What?! Is it true?!</b>

20:53.651 --> 20:57.691
<b>Just give up! You can't beat my brother!</b>

21:04.031 --> 21:06.581
<b>Haki wears out.</b>

21:11.541 --> 21:16.751
<b>If the battle goes longer,
his Color of Observation will become weaker, too...</b>

21:18.421 --> 21:23.221
<b>You look dumb
but you're sharp at fighting.</b>

21:23.641 --> 21:25.891
<b>But that's not good enough!</b>

21:28.641 --> 21:32.771
<b>Don't look with your eyes.
Feel other's presence.</b>

21:32.941 --> 21:33.691
<b>Okay!</b>

21:37.151 --> 21:38.231
<b>All right!</b>

21:38.781 --> 21:39.781
<b>Come on!</b>

21:42.701 --> 21:43.741
<b>Damn you!</b>

21:44.031 --> 21:45.911
<b>Don't lose your composure!</b>

21:45.951 --> 21:49.621
<b>Feel how your enemy will move next...</b>

21:49.661 --> 21:51.911
<b><i>....before he moves.</i></b>

21:56.381 --> 21:57.461
<b><i>Luffy.</i></b>

21:57.881 --> 21:59.711
<b>I gave you lessons</b>

21:59.761 --> 22:05.431
<b>but Haki becomes even stronger
in the heat of actual battle.</b>

22:06.051 --> 22:12.691
<b>The more you face tough enemies,
the stronger you'll be.</b>

22:16.401 --> 22:20.111
<b>I wonder if I can see
slightly ahead into the future, too.</b>

22:20.281 --> 22:24.411
<b>What are you talking about?!
Don't push your luck, you short-ass!</b>

22:36.921 --> 22:38.791
<b>I wanna surpass him!</b>

22:50.141 --> 22:53.481
<b>I wanna defeat him at full strength!</b>

22:55.481 --> 22:56.901
<b>The man with...</b>

22:58.151 --> 23:00.071
<b>...a bounty of a billion!</b>

23:09.741 --> 23:13.291
<b><i>Sanji, Bege, and the others cooperate to transport the cake.</i></b>

23:13.331 --> 23:19.841
<b><i>But the enraged Oven turns the sea into a burning hell
to block their way!</i></b>

23:19.881 --> 23:25.881
<b><i>When the ship catches fire and they are driven into a corner,
a savior emerges before them?!</i></b>

23:26.051 --> 23:31.181
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Cake Sank?! Sanji and Bege's Getaway Battle!"</b>

23:31.221 --> 23:33.971
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
