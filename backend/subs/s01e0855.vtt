20:19.241 --> 20:21.831
<b><i>Yeah, good job!</i></b>

20:21.831 --> 20:22.881
<b>Clank.</b>

20:23.571 --> 20:26.211
<b>And that's how it is...</b>

20:26.921 --> 20:29.751
<b>So Luffy-<i>kun</i> and the others are okay.</b>

20:29.921 --> 20:33.051
<b>What should we do now?</b>

20:36.681 --> 20:39.181
<b>Let's go! Set sail!</b>

20:39.721 --> 20:41.421
<b>Roger!</b>

20:42.521 --> 20:44.731
<b>Muscle Balloon!</b>

21:02.871 --> 21:06.291
<b>Why do I have to just stand here and watch...</b>

21:08.921 --> 21:11.421
<b>...when I know you'll upgrade your power?</b>

21:27.761 --> 21:29.981
<b>Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.</b>

21:32.141 --> 21:36.201
<b>I'm telling you that I'm 
not underestimating you!</b>

21:49.381 --> 21:50.631
<b>Mirror Mochi!</b>

21:50.881 --> 21:53.211
<b>What? Those are <i>mochi</i>, too?!</b>

21:53.341 --> 21:56.671
<b>Oh, no! Once they come down on me,
I'll be buried alive!</b>

21:57.051 --> 21:58.881
<b>Yes, you'll be choked!</b>

21:59.971 --> 22:01.411
<b>You're dead!</b>

22:01.851 --> 22:04.891
<b>No one's ever gotten away from my <i>mochi</i>!</b>

22:14.161 --> 22:15.111
<b>Here's a finishing touch...</b>

22:26.871 --> 22:32.121
<b>I'm sorry that I have to wrap it up this way...
I was getting a little irritated!</b>

22:32.941 --> 22:35.251
<b>Since it took me a lot of 
time and trouble to beat you,</b>

22:35.251 --> 22:38.551
<b>I'm 40 minutes late for today's <i>merienda</i>.</b>

22:43.131 --> 22:44.511
<b>The suffering won't last long...</b>

22:47.931 --> 22:49.691
<b>Goodbye, Straw Hat...</b>

23:09.881 --> 23:12.171
<b><i><i>The "merienda," the time of day when</i></i></b>

23:12.171 --> 23:15.441
<b><i>Katakuri concentrates his mind, 
takes place in a forbidden shrine.</i></b>

23:15.961 --> 23:20.011
<b><i>It's a holy ritual which even 
his siblings have never seen!</i></b>

23:20.421 --> 23:25.681
<b><i>The furious Luffy closes in on the 
invincible superhuman Katakuri's hidden secret!</i></b>

23:26.141 --> 23:30.431
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Forbidden Secret! Katakuri's Merienda!"</b>

23:30.431 --> 23:32.901
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
