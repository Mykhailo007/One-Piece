16:36.851 --> 16:40.231
<b>I'm their father! We're...</b>

16:40.231 --> 16:44.611
<b>"Family"?
Don't overestimate yourself.</b>

16:53.851 --> 16:55.601
<b>Linlin!</b>

16:55.941 --> 16:58.541
<b>They're my children!</b>

16:58.541 --> 17:00.711
<b>Please!</b>

17:00.711 --> 17:05.591
<b>I wanna hold them at least once!</b>

17:06.201 --> 17:09.841
<b>Linlin!</b>

17:09.841 --> 17:14.411
<b>They're... my children...</b>

17:16.331 --> 17:19.441
<b><i>That was 26 years ago...</i></b>

17:20.131 --> 17:24.651
<b><i>Chiffon...
I'm so happy to see you even just once.</i></b>

17:24.921 --> 17:28.631
<b><i>It seems like you're being chased,</i></b>

17:29.801 --> 17:33.491
<b><i>but I'm glad that you look happy...</i></b>

17:39.601 --> 17:41.691
<b>What's the matter, Pez?</b>

17:41.691 --> 17:46.921
<b>You'll be fine!
We're leaving the hot sea soon!</b>

17:47.701 --> 17:50.991
<b>There's nothing to be afraid of!</b>

17:56.231 --> 17:58.811
<b>Stop, Mama!</b>

17:58.811 --> 18:00.351
<b>Shut up!</b>

18:01.501 --> 18:05.361
<b>Why did I give birth to twins?!</b>

18:05.591 --> 18:10.561
<b>You're probably a failure just like Lola!</b>

18:10.561 --> 18:12.431
<b>Stop...!</b>

18:13.681 --> 18:18.461
<b>Kids who don't serve a purpose for me
aren't my family!</b>

18:22.561 --> 18:27.441
<b>Don't show your stupid face to me!</b>

18:29.901 --> 18:34.641
<b>It's alright. Daddy and Mommy are right here.</b>

18:35.791 --> 18:39.101
<b><i>I've always been worried.</i></b>

18:39.621 --> 18:42.611
<b><i>Did you have hard days?</i></b>

18:43.081 --> 18:46.321
<b><i>Did you have lonely days?</i></b>

18:46.671 --> 18:51.951
<b><i>I'm sorry that I couldn't be there for you
on those days...</i></b>

18:53.681 --> 18:55.531
<b><i>I know it's late,</i></b>

18:56.511 --> 18:58.911
<b><i>but let me say this.</i></b>

18:59.931 --> 19:01.871
<b>Congratulations...</b>

19:01.871 --> 19:04.461
<b>...on your marriage!</b>

19:04.461 --> 19:08.111
<b>Chiffon!!</b>

19:08.441 --> 19:09.631
<b>What?!</b>

19:19.661 --> 19:23.561
<b>--We got out of it-<i>rero</i>!
--Let's keep this up and lose them!</b>

19:26.591 --> 19:29.631
<b>The cake just barely made it through.</b>

19:31.721 --> 19:34.531
<b>Let's hurry up! We don't have time!</b>

19:34.531 --> 19:36.521
<b>We'll start decorating!</b>

19:36.521 --> 19:38.181
<b>--Okay!
--Yeah!</b>

19:38.681 --> 19:41.351
<b>ON THE SEA - THE SUNNY</b>

19:43.691 --> 19:45.751
<b>There you are!</b>

19:45.751 --> 19:49.461
<b>Give me the cake!</b>

20:01.541 --> 20:05.401
<b>B-B... B-B-Big Mom?!</b>

20:05.401 --> 20:08.151
<b>No matter how you look at it,
she's too strong for us!</b>

20:08.591 --> 20:09.821
<b>What should we do?!</b>

20:11.611 --> 20:14.571
<b>Maybe we'd better run here...</b>

20:14.931 --> 20:18.531
<b>If we stop, that'll be the end!
Let's just run!</b>

20:21.271 --> 20:24.811
<b>--Here we go!
--I'll go first!</b>

20:24.811 --> 20:27.071
<b>I'll get them!</b>

20:27.071 --> 20:29.491
<b>Oh? Who's our enemy?</b>

20:29.491 --> 20:31.321
<b>It's the Straw Hats!</b>

20:31.321 --> 20:35.591
<b>Oh, yeah! But I don't see the straw hat!</b>

20:35.591 --> 20:38.721
<b>Excuse me! Where did the Straw Hats go?!</b>

20:38.721 --> 20:40.391
<b>They went that way!</b>

20:40.391 --> 20:41.411
<b>What?!</b>

20:41.411 --> 20:45.061
<b>--Let's go! It's that way!
--Thanks for your kindness!</b>

20:45.061 --> 20:48.151
<b>Oh! I can't go any farther!</b>

20:51.251 --> 20:54.151
<b>--What were they?
--I don't know.</b>

20:56.341 --> 20:58.321
<b>Idiots!</b>

20:58.551 --> 21:01.701
<b>Why are all of those shells so useless?!</b>

21:01.701 --> 21:03.441
<b>What's going on?!</b>

21:03.441 --> 21:07.461
<b>As you know, when Mama isn't in her right mind,
they become undisciplined!</b>

21:07.461 --> 21:09.611
<b>Let me go!</b>

21:09.611 --> 21:11.171
<b>No, me!</b>

21:11.171 --> 21:16.151

<b>Mama hasn't slowed down...
We're at full speed, too!</b>

21:23.391 --> 21:25.311
<b>Why can't we catch up to them?!</b>

21:27.251 --> 21:31.111
<b>Well, they have Jimbei

<b>Even if you just ran away,
