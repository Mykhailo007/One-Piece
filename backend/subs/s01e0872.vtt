<b>Ring, ring, ring... Clank.</b>

14:42.861 --> 14:43.911
<b><i>This is Sanji!</i></b>

14:43.911 --> 14:44.911
<b>Oh, Sanji!</b>

14:44.911 --> 14:45.911
<b>Luffy...</b>

14:46.951 --> 14:48.001
<b>...made it!</b>

14:49.581 --> 14:51.581
<b>Yes!</b>

14:59.551 --> 15:00.971
<b>It's Straw Hat!</b>

15:00.971 --> 15:04.171
<b>--Pekoms was hiding him!
--Get him!</b>

15:05.141 --> 15:08.661
<b>He threw dust in Big Bro Katakuri's eyes
and came out...</b>

15:08.661 --> 15:10.521
<b>That's pretty impressive!</b>

15:10.521 --> 15:13.271
<b>I'm gonna go first!</b>

15:13.271 --> 15:14.941
<b>Ya-hoo!</b>

15:16.821 --> 15:17.781
<b>Look up!</b>

15:20.241 --> 15:21.971
<b>It wasn't smart to jump...</b>

15:22.571 --> 15:25.451
<b>You're an easy target!</b>

15:27.791 --> 15:29.901
<b>Just surrender!</b>

15:35.481 --> 15:36.751
<b>Big Bro Raisin!</b>

15:37.461 --> 15:39.131
<b>Who is that?!</b>

15:39.961 --> 15:40.921
<b>Sanji!</b>

15:41.881 --> 15:43.011
<b>Did you win?!</b>

15:43.591 --> 15:44.361
<b>Yeah!</b>

15:47.811 --> 15:49.131
<b>I knew it!</b>

15:50.021 --> 15:53.231
<b>--They're trying to get away through the air!
--That's Black-Leg!</b>

15:54.111 --> 15:55.161
<b>How simple...</b>

15:55.481 --> 15:56.941
<b>That's to be expected.</b>

15:56.941 --> 16:00.151
<b>We can use Geppo, too!</b>

16:00.151 --> 16:01.491
<b>One!</b>

16:01.491 --> 16:02.571
<b>Two!</b>

16:02.571 --> 16:03.741
<b>Three!</b>

16:03.741 --> 16:04.911
<b>Four!</b>

16:04.911 --> 16:06.071
<b>Five!</b>

16:19.461 --> 16:23.151
<b><i>Straw Hat... Black-Leg...</i></b>

16:24.511 --> 16:27.431
<b><i>I've got more in me!</i></b>

16:27.971 --> 16:29.931
<b><i>Isn't that right,</i></b>

16:30.391 --> 16:32.791
<b><i>Big Bro Pedro?!</i></b>

16:33.481 --> 16:36.851
<b><i>To let them get away...</i></b>

17:00.341 --> 17:02.001
<b>Is that Pekoms?</b>

17:04.261 --> 17:05.301
<b>Pekoms!</b>

17:05.301 --> 17:06.681
<b>Don't get in our way!</b>

17:08.391 --> 17:09.921
<b>You should've been dead!</b>

17:13.931 --> 17:15.191
<b>How's that?</b>

17:21.901 --> 17:25.591
<b>He's unbelievably strong but
seems out of control!</b>

17:25.591 --> 17:26.991
<b>He's just a wild beast!</b>

17:57.891 --> 18:00.001
<b><i>Stop, Pekoms!</i></b>

18:03.361 --> 18:04.411
<b><i>Pekoms...</i></b>

18:08.491 --> 18:09.781
<b><i>Everything's gonna be all right!</i></b>

18:13.371 --> 18:15.091
<b>Big Bro...</b>

18:32.601 --> 18:36.491
<b>Take... Straw Hat...</b>

18:37.101 --> 18:40.421
<b>Get clear away... at any cost...</b>

18:44.441 --> 18:45.161
<b>Okay!</b>

19:11.151 --> 19:12.591
<b>Don't push your luck!</b>

19:17.311 --> 19:20.311
<b>Make it so he'll never see the full moon again!</b>

19:48.251 --> 19:51.171
<b>Pekoms!!</b>

19:53.761 --> 19:57.181
<b><i>Everything went all right...</i></b>

19:58.181 --> 20:00.631
<b><i>Big Bro...</i></b>

20:08.981 --> 20:11.511
<b>Not paying attention....</b>

20:11.511 --> 20:14.031
<b>...is disrespectful-<i>yu</i>!</b>

20:21.001 --> 20:25.961
<b>When you're vastly outnumbered,
it's meaningless...</b>

20:25.961 --> 20:28.231
<b>...no matter how hard you struggle.</b>

20:29.801 --> 20:30.881
<b>It's over.</b>

20:33.801 --> 20:34.801
<b>Dammit!</b>

20:38.971 --> 20:39.721
<b>What?!</b>

20:40.851 --> 20:43.481
<b>There's an explosion at the harbor!</b>

20:45.191 --> 20:47.651
<b>What's that?!</b>

20:47.651 --> 20:50.321
<b>Hey, what happened-<i>nie</i>?!</b>

20:50.691 --> 20:53.991
<b>Those ships at the shore are burning!</b>

20:53.991 --> 20:55.401
<b>What's going on?!</b>

20:55.721 --> 20:56.721
<b>Is it a bombing?!</b>

20:57.111 --> 20:59.451
<b>It's a fleet, Snack-<i>sama</i>!</b>

20:59.451 --> 21:00.571
<b>Who are they?!</b>

21:00.991 --> 21:02.041
<b>I-It's...</b>

21:02.491 --> 21:04.081
<b>...Germa's fleet!</b>

21:05.251 --> 21:07.421
<b>Why are they here?!</b>

21:07.421 --> 21:10.381
<b>I thought they were fully destroyed several hours ago!</b>

21:10.841 --> 21:13.341
<b><i>Next! Prepare to fire!</i></b>

21:13.711 --> 21:15.421
<b>Germa 66!</b>

21:16.361 --> 21:18.141
<b>Why are they here?!</b>

22:11.611 --> 22:13.361
<b>Dammit!</b>

22:25.581 --> 22:27.661
<b>You bastards!</b>

22:28.211 --> 22:31.081
<b>Thank you for what you did for us at the Tea Party,

<b>Germa 66!</b>

22:36.841 --> 22:38.421
<b>Why are you here?!</b>

22:39.011 --> 22:41.211
<b>What a coincidence, Sanji.</b>

22:48.771 --> 22:50.941
<b>We wanted to give these fools...</b>

22:51.561 --> 22:54.541
<b>...a crushing blow, too!</b>

23:05.351 --> 23:08.981
<b><i><i>Ichiji's sparking techniques, Niji's electric attacks,
