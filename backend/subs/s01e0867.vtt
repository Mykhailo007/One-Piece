17:06.591 --> 17:09.481
<b><i>We need them all, Big Bro Oven!</i></b>

17:09.781 --> 17:11.291
<b>Can you believe this?!</b>

17:11.291 --> 17:15.181
<b>That big explosion of the chateau
was intentional, too!</b>

17:15.181 --> 17:16.521
<b>What?!</b>

17:16.521 --> 17:21.421
<b>Even though he's a Rookie and they're a small group,
don't underestimate them!</b>

17:21.421 --> 17:23.791
<b>If we let them escape, we'll suffer shame!</b>

17:24.361 --> 17:28.341
<b>Don't worry...
We'll get them right here for sure!</b>

17:29.291 --> 17:33.161
<b>Listen! About three hours from now,
at 1 AM,</b>

17:33.531 --> 17:38.471
<b>the separated members of the Straw Hats
will meet up here at Cacao Island.</b>

17:39.341 --> 17:43.561
<b>Think of it as your last chance
to kill them all!</b>

17:43.561 --> 17:44.731
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

17:45.361 --> 17:52.001
<b>If by any chance Straw Hat appears,
he'll come out of a mirror on the island!</b>

17:52.001 --> 17:55.571
<b>Everyone, go home
and break all the mirrors in the town!</b>

17:58.231 --> 18:01.111
<b>Didn't you hear me?! Just do it!</b>

18:01.111 --> 18:03.531
<b>Please! Even precious ones?!</b>

18:03.861 --> 18:08.821
<b>He's a power-user. If you have a mirror
that you don't wanna break, sink it into the sea.</b>

18:08.821 --> 18:12.001
<b>You can salvage later! Anyway...</b>

18:13.441 --> 18:17.341
<b>This is to be the only unbroken 
mirror on this island!</b>

18:22.421 --> 18:26.391
<b>No exceptions!</b>

18:26.831 --> 18:31.361
<b>If anyone allows Straw Hat to
get out of their mirror,</b>

18:31.361 --> 18:33.731
<b>I'll execute their whole family!</b>

18:34.561 --> 18:35.631
<b>Hurry up!</b>

18:36.391 --> 18:37.771
<b>Y-Yes, sir!</b>

18:41.521 --> 18:44.741
<b>Don't think you can get away, Straw Hat!</b>

18:45.491 --> 18:49.241
<b>To you, this is no exit...</b>

18:49.791 --> 18:52.131
<b>It's the entrance to hell!</b>

19:07.011 --> 19:09.481
<b><i>What's the matter, Straw Hat?</i></b>

19:17.601 --> 19:19.261
<b><i>What are you doing?</i></b>

19:19.811 --> 19:22.201
<b><i>Why did you let up?!</i></b>

19:28.281 --> 19:31.361
<b>I was just starting to think highly of you...</b>

19:34.991 --> 19:37.041
<b>but you disappointed me!</b>

20:14.071 --> 20:16.101
<b>I think I saw it!</b>

20:16.951 --> 20:18.341
<b>Did I imagine it?</b>

20:20.121 --> 20:22.311
<b>Imagining is fine.</b>

20:22.831 --> 20:26.931
<b>The Color of Observation
is an extension of imagination!</b>

20:33.211 --> 20:37.151
<b>You have to be able to 
sense it instinctively!</b>

20:37.151 --> 20:39.231
<b><i>Instinctively?!</i></b>

21:09.921 --> 21:11.371
<b>He stands up again!</b>

21:11.671 --> 21:13.561
<b>Look how his feet shake.</b>

21:14.511 --> 21:16.601
<b><i>All right! Another shot!</i></b>

21:19.351 --> 21:24.451
<b><i>This time, I'll give you a Numbing Needle
that's 10-times more effective than the last one!</i></b>

21:35.281 --> 21:37.961
<b><i>A monkey who doesn't know when to give up.</i></b>

21:38.261 --> 21:40.421
<b><i>Drop dead already!</i></b>

21:47.001 --> 21:48.011
<b><i>Numbing Needle!</i></b>

22:05.141 --> 22:09.161
<b><i>What? He dodged my silent needle?!</i></b>

22:14.951 --> 22:17.041
<b><i>But he fell!</i></b>

23:05.621 --> 23:10.291
<b><i><i>When Katakuri finds out what is up with Luffy,
he stabs his stomach with the Mole</i></i></b>

23:10.291 --> 23:13.471
<b><i><i>and reveal his secret which he has been hiding
for some time.</i></i></b>

23:13.831 --> 23:16.091
<b><i><i>Stake everything on this duel!
</i></i></b>

23:16.091 --> 23:20.971
<b><i>Against the determined Katakuri, 
will Luffy be able to stand up?</i></b>

23:20.971 --> 23:26.061
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
