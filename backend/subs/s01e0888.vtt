<b><i>...the real deal!</i></b>

15:44.521 --> 15:48.031
<b>If you were to take a trip,
where would you want to go?</b>

15:56.741 --> 16:01.721
<b><i>Kuma gradually lost his personality
in the process of the modifications.</i></b>

16:02.291 --> 16:04.811
<b><i>However, with his own remaining free will,</i></b>

16:04.811 --> 16:08.591
<b><i>he saved the Straw Hats by sending them 
away to different parts of the world.</i></b>

16:09.091 --> 16:13.051
<b>We will never meet again.</b>

16:19.781 --> 16:21.061
<b>Farewell...</b>

16:29.821 --> 16:33.321
<b><i>Later, when Kuma was deployed 
in the Paramount War,</i></b>

16:33.321 --> 16:35.831
<b>he had already received 
his final modifications.</b>

16:35.831 --> 16:38.741
<b>Kuma! Kuma, that's enough!</b>

16:38.741 --> 16:42.501
<b>It's me! Did you forget my face?!</b>

16:43.161 --> 16:47.001
<b>If you don't stop, I'm gonna fight back
although I'm a gentle person!</b>

16:48.171 --> 16:52.551
<b>I don't know how you know him
but you may as well give up!</b>

16:52.921 --> 16:57.681
<b>It's no use talking to him, Emporio Ivankov,
a top officer of the Revolutionary Army!</b>

16:58.071 --> 17:01.691
<b>You...! What do you mean?!
What's wrong with him?!</b>

17:01.691 --> 17:06.611
<b>You're a friend of 
Bartholomew Kuma I suppose.</b>

17:06.611 --> 17:11.571
<b>He was once called Tyrant Kuma
and now he is...</b>

17:12.111 --> 17:14.451
<b>...dead.</b>

17:15.661 --> 17:17.301
<b>What are you talking...</b>

17:17.941 --> 17:23.391
<b>In fact, he volunteered to be a guinea pig for
a study to build a human weapon...</b>

17:23.391 --> 17:25.881
<b>...run by the Government.</b>

17:27.591 --> 17:32.111
<b>Stop lying! Kuma hates the Government!</b>

17:32.111 --> 17:35.221
<b>He wouldn't sacrifice his life for them.</b>

17:35.221 --> 17:38.391
<b>I know that he wouldn't do that!</b>

17:40.431 --> 17:43.021
<b>But now, he doesn't even</b>

17:43.021 --> 17:47.521
<b>remember that he was born human
so he is no better than dead.</b>

17:47.521 --> 17:51.351
<b>He is a monster who fights
as the Government tells him.</b>

17:52.651 --> 17:55.701
<b>He is Pacifista PX-0!</b>

17:56.061 --> 17:58.571
<b>So you better forget about the past!</b>

18:11.701 --> 18:16.351
<b><i>And two years later,
the Straw Hats got back together...</i></b>

18:16.351 --> 18:20.681
<b>There's something that I have to
tell you all about.</b>

18:21.851 --> 18:27.971
<b>I couldn't believe my eyes
when I got to the Sunny a few days ago...</b>

18:32.281 --> 18:33.941
<b>I've been expecting you.</b>

18:35.321 --> 18:37.491
<b>What are you doing here?!</b>

18:38.611 --> 18:40.881
<b>Mission accomplished.</b>

18:50.421 --> 18:53.111
<b>There isn't even a scratch on the Sunny.</b>

18:54.341 --> 18:57.131
<b>And Rayleigh told me later...</b>

18:58.051 --> 19:00.531
<b>I work for the Revolutionary Army.</b>

19:00.891 --> 19:04.561
<b>Since I have a connection with them,
I wanna let them get away from here.</b>

19:04.561 --> 19:08.211
<b>I think you guys half expected that.</b>

19:08.211 --> 19:12.021
<b>He saved our lives!</b>

19:12.021 --> 19:13.791
<b>Just remember that.</b>

19:13.791 --> 19:21.001
<b>Bartholomew Kuma turned out to be
one of our greatest allies.</b>

19:21.741 --> 19:25.091
<b><i><i>Why did he help Luffy and the 
others get out of trouble</i></i></b>

19:25.091 --> 19:27.441
<b><i>and give them chances to escape?</i></b>

19:28.231 --> 19:32.541
<b><i>He can't explain his motive now...</i></b>

19:42.081 --> 19:43.181
<b><i>Kuma!</i></b>

19:47.271 --> 19:53.571
<b>This is exciting-<i>eh</i>! Father-<i>sama</i> finally got to rent
the invincible slave Kuma!</b>

19:53.571 --> 19:57.321
<b>It's convenient to have 
a Warlord as a slave-<i>eh</i>!</b>

19:57.901 --> 19:59.401
<b>It feels good to hit him!</b>

20:02.201 --> 20:03.911
<b>It feels good to stab him!</b>

20:11.291 --> 20:15.671
<b>He doesn't even scream.
He's a top-class slave-<i>eh</i>!</b>

20:15.921 --> 20:21.271
<b>Nice, Father-<i>sama</i>! I want one, too-<i>eh</i>!</b>

20:21.271 --> 20:24.871
<b>Ow, ow, ow... I'm gonna die-<i>eh</i>...</b>

20:24.871 --> 20:27.581
<b>Keep quiet, Charlos-<i>sama</i>!</b>

20:38.781 --> 20:39.741

20:46.311 --> 20:51.171
