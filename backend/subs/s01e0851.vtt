16:40.691 --> 16:42.321
<b>They have no future.</b>

<b>How should I make...</b>

16:47.411 --> 16:50.641
<b>...his friends suffer to feel satisfied?!</b>

17:12.201 --> 17:16.081
<b>WHOLE CAKE ISLAND</b>

17:13.471 --> 17:16.471
<b>Huh? Why, why, why?</b>

17:16.471 --> 17:18.851
<b>Everyone's gone!</b>

17:18.851 --> 17:23.431
<b>I really wanna eat fire!
I'm losing my strength...</b>

17:24.031 --> 17:27.491
<b>I wanna eat thunderclouds, too...</b>

<b>SEA WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF TOTTO LAND</b>

17:32.871 --> 17:37.751
<b>Oh... So Lola-<i>chan</i> from Thriller Bark
was a master at making chocolate!</b>

17:38.041 --> 17:42.131
<b>That's right. Lola was the Minister of Chocolate
running Cacao Island...</b>

17:42.171 --> 17:46.671
<b>But ever since she left,
that seat has remained empty.</b>

17:46.841 --> 17:48.551
<b>Oh, why is that?</b>

17:48.761 --> 17:54.681
<b>Because everyone's favorite candidate here
keeps rejecting the offer...</b>

17:54.811 --> 17:55.881
<b>Right, Pudding?</b>

17:56.431 --> 17:58.981
<b>B-Because, to me...</b>

17:59.441 --> 18:03.901
<b>Big Sis Lola is the only Minister of Chocolate
for Chocolat Town!</b>

18:03.941 --> 18:06.741
<b>And I'm hoping she'll be back someday...</b>

18:07.241 --> 18:08.861
<b>I know what you mean but...</b>

18:10.861 --> 18:11.941
<b>Oh?</b>

18:12.321 --> 18:14.161
<b>Oh? Oh? Oh?</b>

18:14.491 --> 18:16.451
<b>Could I be mistaken?</b>

18:16.831 --> 18:17.751
<b>No...</b>

<b>Hey! Hey!</b>

18:28.511 --> 18:30.851
<b>Hey!</b>

18:32.601 --> 18:34.641
<b>She's gone now...</b>

<b>Chiffon...</b>

18:36.971 --> 18:40.851
<b>Hey! Get out of there already, Pudding!</b>

18:42.311 --> 18:44.681
<b>N... No way!</b>

18:44.681 --> 18:47.991
<b>I'm wearing a wedding dress now!</b>

18:48.031 --> 18:51.271
<b>If I sit on the carpet with that man,</b>

18:51.271 --> 18:56.421
<b>people will think that we're newlyweds

18:58.581 --> 18:59.581
<b>What people?</b>

18:59.751 --> 19:04.771
<b>You never know who's watching!
And it bothers me if they think so!</b>

19:06.301 --> 19:09.261
<b>It.. It... It really bothers me, okay?!</b>

19:09.421 --> 19:12.181
<b>I feel bad about it but don't fall.</b>

19:12.801 --> 19:15.431
<b>S-Shut up!</b>

19:15.641 --> 19:20.731
<b><i>Oh! How kind he is!
He's worried about me!</i></b>

19:21.161 --> 19:26.731
<b>Who do you think you are?!

19:26.981 --> 19:28.611
<b>There's Cacao Island!</b>

19:28.781 --> 19:32.071
<b>Alright! Let's start making the cake

<b>Hey! Did you hear what I said, Sanji...</b>

19:37.491 --> 19:38.871
<b>...-<i>san</i>!</b>

<b>I'm following your lead on this...</b>

20:10.941 --> 20:12.531
<b>Am I doing it wrong?</b>

20:19.791 --> 20:23.001
<b>But this way, it's more efficient.</b>

20:30.961 --> 20:32.551
<b>That's our Katakuri-<i>sama</i>!</b>

20:32.841 --> 20:37.551
<b>Straw Hat only has two arms
but Katakuri-<i>sama</i> has dozens!</b>

20:39.681 --> 20:42.181
<b>He's throwing ten times more punches!</b>

20:49.231 --> 20:51.321
<b>Katakuri-<i>sama</i>, that's so brutal!</b>

21:12.811 --> 21:14.211
<b>You're quite tough.</b>

21:18.591 --> 21:20.961
<b>But I guess you see now.</b>

21:21.511 --> 21:24.931
<b>As I said before, in terms of ability,</b>

21:24.981 --> 21:28.001
<b>anything you can do, I can do better.</b>

21:28.601 --> 21:32.981
<b>You're inferior to me in speed

<b>I can't see Straw Hat now, either!</b>

<b>Don't tell me he can move

22:22.411 --> 22:23.771
<b>No way!</b>

22:24.291 --> 22:25.581
<b>He disappeared again!</b>

22:37.671 --> 22:40.721
<b>I knew Katakuri-<i>sama</i> is
