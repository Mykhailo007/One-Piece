16:27.481 --> 16:28.371
<b>Damn Germa!</b>

16:28.371 --> 16:31.891
<b>I guess I bought some 
time for them to escape.</b>

16:32.431 --> 16:34.561
<b>Anyway, just get us over the wall!</b>

16:34.561 --> 16:37.471
<b>That's the only thing on my mind!</b>

16:37.471 --> 16:39.651
<b>There are still more of them!</b>

16:45.131 --> 16:48.031
<b>If I can make it over the wall,
I can survive!</b>

16:49.551 --> 16:53.161
<b>O-Over the wall...</b>

16:54.021 --> 16:58.381
<b>I'm gonna be free soon!</b>

16:58.561 --> 17:00.231
<b>Lick.</b>

17:00.231 --> 17:03.011
<b>I'm not gonna let them get away.</b>

17:03.431 --> 17:05.801
<b>Candy Wall!</b>

17:09.221 --> 17:10.101
<b>Oh, no!</b>

17:13.911 --> 17:15.231
<b>What?!</b>

17:15.591 --> 17:19.101
<b>Wh-What the hell is that?!</b>

17:20.291 --> 17:22.251
<b>Perospero must've done it...</b>

17:22.251 --> 17:24.901
<b>That was our last hope...</b>

17:29.091 --> 17:32.441
<b>It's over... Oh, my freedom...</b>

17:33.001 --> 17:35.661
<b>Shoot! We'll be engulfed in it!
Go back!</b>

17:35.661 --> 17:38.211
<b>No, just go straight!</b>

17:47.281 --> 17:48.681
<b>Black...</b>

17:48.991 --> 17:50.021
<b>...Bug!</b>

17:58.161 --> 17:59.081
<b>Go!</b>

17:59.081 --> 18:00.981
<b>What?! But...</b>

18:09.911 --> 18:11.411
<b>Oops...</b>

18:13.261 --> 18:18.081
<b>You saved us! Germa 66!</b>

18:18.081 --> 18:22.161
<b>Yay! He got through the wall of candy!
Only Germa could've done it!</b>

18:23.561 --> 18:26.301
<b>Go! Caesar!</b>

18:26.611 --> 18:28.491
<b>He's a loser though!</b>

18:29.661 --> 18:34.141
<b>Dammit! I got this far now!
I don't wanna die!</b>

18:34.561 --> 18:39.581
<b>Once I get over the wall, I...
I can be...</b>

18:39.581 --> 18:42.891

19:05.281 --> 19:07.631
<b>I have no choice. I gotta jump off...</b>

19:07.631 --> 19:11.051
<b>What will you do with the Tamate Box,
Du Feld?</b>

19:11.351 --> 19:12.971
<b>Y-You are...</b>

19:14.141 --> 19:16.811
<b>...Stussy! Were you watching?!</b>

19:23.971 --> 19:25.791
<b>Ow, ow, ow...</b>

19:25.791 --> 19:28.921
<b>But now I can see what's in it...</b>

19:31.471 --> 19:36.331
<b>The hidden undersea treasure...

<b>Of course, I'll lay the blame on you.</b>

19:59.261 --> 20:02.911
<b>You'll write a story like that,

<b><i>She knew I was here!</i></b>

20:04.341 --> 20:08.091
<b>Sure but can I at least get a scoop on
what's in it?!</b>

20:08.091 --> 20:12.091
<b>Yes, you can take pictures. 
You're quick to understand.</b>

20:12.091 --> 20:13.951
<b>That's maybe because you're 
a manipulator of information.</b>

20:13.951 --> 20:16.121
