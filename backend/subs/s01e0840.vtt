14:40.721 --> 14:44.011
<b>I'm the only one who'll get hurt.</b>

14:44.351 --> 14:48.731
<b>As long as you guys stay here,
you're not gonna get affected!</b>

14:48.891 --> 14:53.151
<b>--Come to think of it...
--It's only Bege-<i>san</i> who is suffering.</b>

14:55.061 --> 14:57.731
<b>We can hear Big Mom's voice...</b>

15:00.111 --> 15:02.451
<b>But it remains calm inside.</b>

15:06.121 --> 15:07.991
<b>That's right...</b>

15:08.041 --> 15:12.921
<b>And it won't change
even if I turn back to my human form.</b>

15:13.211 --> 15:16.631
<b>So you mean,
we'll be safe as long as we stay here...</b>

15:17.461 --> 15:22.341
<b>Listen... I'll change back to my human form
keeping you guys inside.</b>

15:22.381 --> 15:26.931
<b>Then, Caesar will carry me and fly away
to escape.</b>

15:26.971 --> 15:30.601
<b>If it goes well, we can get out of trouble.</b>

15:32.061 --> 15:36.231
<b>Hey! How could you put my life in danger
without even asking me, you fool!</b>

15:36.271 --> 15:38.571
<b>That's like digging our own grave!</b>

15:38.611 --> 15:43.911
<b>We'll get riddled with bullets in an instant!
There's no chance of success!</b>

15:43.951 --> 15:46.281
<b>There are many users of the Color of Arms too!</b>

15:46.321 --> 15:48.791
<b>I can turn into gas but it doesn't matter!</b>

15:48.951 --> 15:51.411
<b>You don't know if there's any chance of success!</b>

15:51.581 --> 15:53.621
<b>You can't tell unless you try.</b>

15:53.791 --> 15:56.131
<b>You're only agile when you're escaping!</b>

15:56.291 --> 15:58.631
<b>What did you say, you fools?!</b>

15:58.801 --> 16:00.841
<b>Let me ask you a question.</b>

16:02.591 --> 16:03.551
<b>Sanji...</b>

16:06.591 --> 16:08.641
<b>Why did you save us?</b>

16:10.431 --> 16:15.271
<b>We're hateful enemies to you
and we totally fell into the trap!</b>

16:22.441 --> 16:25.821
<b>Because my <i>father</i> would be sad...</b>

16:27.321 --> 16:30.871
<b>If I had stuck to my resentment
from my old days...</b>

16:34.001 --> 16:35.621
<b>Please let me out!</b>

16:35.671 --> 16:38.381
<b>Dad! I'm sorry!</b>

16:39.791 --> 16:43.591
<b>I'm sorry to be born weak!</b>

16:43.631 --> 16:45.971
<b>Help me, Dad!</b>

16:46.131 --> 16:49.641
<b>Help me! Dad!</b>

16:53.061 --> 16:56.641
<b>He'd be disappointed in me
for becoming such a small-minded rat...</b>

16:56.691 --> 17:00.571
<b>...who'd laugh at your blood family's death.</b>

17:01.271 --> 17:04.691
<b>Don't catch cold.</b>

17:05.491 --> 17:09.071
<b>I don't wanna live a life in which I'm too ashamed...</b>

17:09.121 --> 17:10.831
<b>...to face him!</b>

17:17.581 --> 17:21.091
<b>Don't ever admit that I'm your father...</b>

17:21.841 --> 17:25.721
<b>...in front of other people!</b>

17:30.341 --> 17:33.811
<b>It's a shame that I don't want anyone to know!</b>

17:34.771 --> 17:37.231
<b>You realize that, don't you?</b>

17:40.271 --> 17:42.111
<b>13 years ago,</b>

17:42.151 --> 17:46.651
<b>Vinsmoke Sanji who escaped from Germa
died once at sea...</b>

17:47.451 --> 17:49.991
<b>And that's what you wished for.</b>

18:02.131 --> 18:03.921
<b>So admit this!</b>

18:05.091 --> 18:09.301
<b>You're not my father, Vinsmoke Judge!</b>

18:10.261 --> 18:13.101
<b>Don't ever show yourself in front of us again!</b>

18:37.701 --> 18:39.371
<b>Very well.</b>

18:40.081 --> 18:41.711
<b>I promise...</b>

18:42.211 --> 18:43.961
<b>...I won't approach you...</b>

18:44.251 --> 18:47.341
<b>...or the East Blue!</b>

18:59.271 --> 19:01.771
<b>I already did my part!</b>

19:01.811 --> 19:04.441
<b>Doing more isn't part of our deal!</b>

19:09.491 --> 19:12.071
<b>Come out!</b>

19:12.491 --> 19:16.121
<b>Bege! Straw Hat!</b>

19:17.701 --> 19:19.751
<b><i>Come out!</i></b>

19:19.911 --> 19:21.501
<b>--Honey!
--Father!</b>

19:22.291 --> 19:26.001
<b>I don't wanna be here anymore!</b>

19:28.841 --> 19:32.971
<b>If nothing is done, you'll die too, Caesar!</b>

19:35.181 --> 19:36.851
<b>Open the gate!</b>

19:38.811 --> 19:43.271
<b>Gang Bege!
Until you and Caesar Clown fly away into the sky,</b>

19:43.311 --> 19:45.771
<b>we Germa will escort you!</b>

19:45.941 --> 19:47.401
<b>W-Wait a minute!</b>

19:47.441 --> 19:53.491
<b>Why do you decide what I'm gonna do?!
Your high-handed attitude hasn't changed, Judge!</b>

19:56.531 --> 20:00.081
<b>Oh, yeah... You Germa people can fly too...</b>

20:00.121 --> 20:02.201
<b>Then, we'll leave you behind, okay?</b>

20:02.371 --> 20:03.371
<b>No problem.</b>

20:05.921 --> 20:08.671
<b>Alright, if we need to buy time, I'll...</b>

20:09.881 --> 20:12.341
<b>--That's okay, Luffy.
--But...</b>

20:34.651 --> 20:38.411
<b>I don't wanna be indebted to this "failure"!</b>

20:41.201 --> 20:43.871
<b>That's how they wanna settle it...</b>

20:45.501 --> 20:47.331
<b>Wait, wait! Whoa-whoa!</b>

20:47.381 --> 20:50.541
<b>I didn't say I was gonna do this, you fools!</b>

20:50.751 --> 20:52.251
<b>Caesar!</b>

20:52.801 --> 20:54.221
<b>Shut up and do it!</b>

20:54.381 --> 20:56.881
<b>Ouch!</b>

20:56.931 --> 20:58.931
<b>You'll regret this!</b>

21:02.471 --> 21:05.691
<b>Come on out already!</b>

21:05.731 --> 21:07.271
<b>Bege!</b>

21:07.561 --> 21:10.191
<b>Straw Hat!</b>

21:13.691 --> 21:15.741
<b>Are you ready?</b>

21:16.241 --> 21:17.951
<b>Caesar Clown...</b>

21:18.111 --> 21:22.281
<b>I wasn't ready at all from the beginning!
You guys should protect me!</b>

21:22.451 --> 21:24.751
<b>Alright! Let's go crazy!</b>

21:26.411 --> 21:28.041
<b>You have the wrong idea.</b>

21:28.081 --> 21:33.131
<b>Our mission is to let Caesar and Bege escape
quickly and safely.</b>

21:33.551 --> 21:37.971
<b>This is a battle for evacuation.
Defense is harder than offense.</b>

21:38.131 --> 21:39.551
<b>I know.</b>

21:39.721 --> 21:41.551
<b>I understand the mission.</b>

22:00.161 --> 22:02.071
<b>Get ready to step out!</b>

22:02.281 --> 22:04.491
<b>Getting ready to step out!</b>

22:04.661 --> 22:07.331
<b>We're ready!</b>

22:07.871 --> 22:09.081
<b>Bege!</b>

22:12.131 --> 22:13.381
<b>All right!</b>

22:18.761 --> 22:21.591
<b>I'm gonna deactivate the castle!</b>

22:37.191 --> 22:38.281
<b>Let's go!</b>

22:56.461 --> 22:59.471
<b>Germa! Start attacking!</b>

23:09.431 --> 23:16.021
<b><i>Luffy and Germa 66 join forces
and a deadly escape plan begins!</i></b>

23:16.071 --> 23:20.281
<b><i>Big Mom's furious attacks raise Luffy's fighting spirit!</i></b>

23:20.321 --> 23:25.741
<b><i>To prove himself as the future King of the Pirates,
his special Gear Four techniques blast!</i></b>

23:25.911 --> 23:30.251
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"Escape From the Tea Party! Luffy vs. Big Mom!"</b>

23:30.291 --> 23:33.371
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
