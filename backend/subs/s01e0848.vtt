<b>Damn!</b>

14:03.661 --> 14:07.041
<b>Run! If we get caught,
we're all going to die!</b>

14:10.331 --> 14:13.131
<b>Give me the cake!</b>

14:17.721 --> 14:21.001
<b>You can't get away, Straw Hat!</b>

14:21.001 --> 14:23.841
<b>Come on, Prometheus!</b>

14:23.841 --> 14:25.471
<b>Yes, Mama!</b>

14:27.731 --> 14:28.391
<b>Luffy!</b>

14:29.541 --> 14:31.401
<b>Heavenly...</b>

14:32.461 --> 14:34.271
<b>Run, guys!</b>

14:34.271 --> 14:36.611
<b>...Fire!</b>

15:19.341 --> 15:22.531
<b>Are you tired now, Soul King?</b>

15:24.141 --> 15:25.321
<b>Gavotte...</b>

15:25.611 --> 15:27.161
<b>...Bond en Avant!</b>

15:28.541 --> 15:29.621
<b>It's not working...</b>

15:35.311 --> 15:36.251
<b>Brook!</b>

15:40.031 --> 15:41.631
<b>Are you okay, Brook?!</b>

15:41.631 --> 15:45.341
<b>Don't worry... I can still fight...</b>

15:47.781 --> 15:52.481
<b>You've cut down quite a lot of our troops...</b>

15:52.481 --> 15:56.151
<b>We'll bring you guys down
and take back the Sunny!</b>

15:56.831 --> 16:01.491
<b>You're so naive...
I'll make you face reality.</b>

16:09.681 --> 16:11.071
<b>Huh? What the...</b>

16:11.071 --> 16:12.121
<b>My leg...</b>

16:14.101 --> 16:16.421
<b>Damn! I can't move!</b>

16:16.921 --> 16:17.841
<b>Chopper-<i>san</i>!</b>

16:21.571 --> 16:22.941
<b>Brook!</b>

16:25.471 --> 16:27.011
<b>You fools...</b>

16:27.011 --> 16:32.561
<b>Those candies will slowly 
seep into your bodies.</b>

16:37.541 --> 16:41.461
<b>It's no use.
You won't be able to move from there...</b>

16:45.221 --> 16:46.631
<b>Chopper-<i>san</i>!</b>

16:48.161 --> 16:50.651
<b>Don't panic, don't panic.</b>

16:50.651 --> 16:52.081
<b>Man...</b>

16:52.711 --> 16:59.241
<b>What kind of positive thinking did you have
to believe you could take the ship back?</b>

16:59.241 --> 17:02.871
<b>In order to catch you guys,</b>

17:02.871 --> 17:06.961
<b>we're mobilizing all of our soldiers
across the island</b>

17:06.961 --> 17:10.591
<b>to set up surrounding nets at various places.</b>

17:10.591 --> 17:14.101
<b>You have nowhere to run.</b>

17:15.121 --> 17:18.521
<b>The difference in power is obvious!</b>

17:20.131 --> 17:21.421
<b>Damn!</b>

17:22.211 --> 17:24.961
<b>I... I can't even transform!</b>

17:25.721 --> 17:27.531
<b>Free Chopper-<i>san</i>!</b>

17:27.831 --> 17:30.311
<b>Idiot! It's too late!</b>

17:30.311 --> 17:33.281
<b>It's punishment for standing against me!</b>

17:33.281 --> 17:36.611
<b>I'll turn you into a Candyman and lick you!</b>

17:36.611 --> 17:37.871
<b>Lick!</b>

17:39.051 --> 17:42.081
<b>The candy will coat your whole body,</b>

17:42.081 --> 17:45.331
<b>fill you up inside and stop your breathing.</b>

17:45.331 --> 17:48.341
<b>And with that agony,</b>

17:49.281 --> 17:52.891
<b>it only takes three minutes 
to kill the target!</b>

17:54.441 --> 17:55.351
<b>No way...</b>

17:55.801 --> 18:01.611
<b>And then, it's complete!
A sweet corpse - Candyman!</b>

18:08.471 --> 18:09.831
<b>Chopper-<i>san</i>!</b>

18:09.831 --> 18:11.451
<b>Stop!</b>

18:16.021 --> 18:19.531
<b>It's too late to cry over your choices!</b>

18:19.531 --> 18:22.411
<b>I certainly gave you a chance!</b>

18:22.411 --> 18:26.211
<b>I said I'd let just the two of you go.</b>

18:26.701 --> 18:29.671
<b>You guys really don't know anything!</b>

18:30.611 --> 18:32.671
<b>This island...</b>

18:32.671 --> 18:35.331
<b>...isn't sweet at all!</b>

18:36.291 --> 18:38.741
<b>Chopper-<i>san</i>!</b>

18:40.091 --> 18:43.061
<b>Why don't you count the sound of
the second hand?</b>

18:49.631 --> 18:52.651
<b>That's just what sweet fools 
like you guys deserve...</b>

18:54.431 --> 18:58.071
<b>Oh, stop! I don't wanna get sweetened!</b>

18:58.071 --> 18:59.431
<b>Oh, stop!</b>

19:02.311 --> 19:07.391
<b>I'll turn you into a Candyman and lick you!</b>

19:18.661 --> 19:20.681
<b>Hey, Big Brother Peros!</b>

19:21.871 --> 19:23.271
<b>That's Mama...</b>

19:23.271 --> 19:27.151
<b>Wedding...</b>

19:27.671 --> 19:30.231
<b>Her Hunger Pangs attack won't stop...</b>

19:30.231 --> 19:33.011
<b>Cake!</b>

19:34.221 --> 19:38.071
<b>We have to lead her to 
Pudding on Cacao Island...</b>

19:38.071 --> 19:42.831
<b>If she finds out there's no cake 
on this ship, she'll kill me.</b>

19:47.831 --> 19:50.651
<b>I don't think we have gotten that far yet...</b>

19:54.531 --> 19:57.011
<b>Let me eat!</b>

20:09.051 --> 20:11.401
<b>Cake!</b>

20:11.631 --> 20:14.201
<b>It's the coast! Get to the Sunny!</b>

20:16.011 --> 20:18.781
<b>He was alive? Straw Hat...</b>

20:19.461 --> 20:22.331
<b>It must be our soldiers who got struck
by the lightning...</b>

20:25.901 --> 20:26.921
<b>Who are they?!</b>

20:27.411 --> 20:29.711
<b>The ship has been hijacked!</b>

20:29.711 --> 20:32.301
<b>What? Brook?! Chopper?!</b>

20:32.291 --> 20:33.551
<b>What's that?!</b>

20:35.531 --> 20:37.221
<b>Get back to the Mirroworld.</b>

20:38.621 --> 20:41.211
<b>All of you will end up...</b>

20:41.211 --> 20:44.351
<b>...lying at his feet in a few seconds.</b>

20:46.751 --> 20:48.981
<b>Jump into the mirror!</b>

20:49.221 --> 20:53.521
<b>Perospero and Katakuri...
Those two of all others...</b>

20:53.521 --> 20:55.861
<b>The disaster continues!</b>

20:58.261 --> 21:03.611
<b>It's amazing that you got this far...
I'm impressed.</b>

21:04.851 --> 21:09.121
<b>But your destination is a graveyard!</b>

21:09.121 --> 21:11.841
<b>You must die here!</b>

21:20.031 --> 21:22.261
<b>Candy Maiden!</b>

21:22.261 --> 21:23.771
<b>A wall of candy!</b>

21:23.771 --> 21:28.231
<b>It's obvious that it's not just a wall!</b>

21:33.571 --> 21:35.611
<b>Fish-Man Karate...</b>

21:35.971 --> 21:37.861
<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

<b>Shark Brick Fist!</b>

21:41.781 --> 21:44.121
<b>Jet Bazooka!</b>

21:47.561 --> 21:48.501
<b>Yes!</b>

21:50.441 --> 21:52.031
<b>Not yet, not yet...</b>

21:52.031 --> 21:55.171
<b>Don't underestimate me!</b>

21:56.321 --> 21:57.841
<b>Huh? What is it?!</b>

22:01.321 --> 22:03.511
<b>Candy Maiden...</b>

22:04.121 --> 22:05.971
<b>...Decoration!</b>

22:06.751 --> 22:08.831
<b>It's gigantic...</b>

22:09.631 --> 22:11.271
<b>This is it!</b>

22:17.011 --> 22:18.861
<b>No one can get through here!</b>

22:21.391 --> 22:23.121
<b>Go around and get to the ship!</b>

22:25.011 --> 22:26.911
<b>No, run straight!</b>

22:32.901 --> 22:35.341
<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

22:39.281 --> 22:41.761
<b>...Red Hawk!</b>
