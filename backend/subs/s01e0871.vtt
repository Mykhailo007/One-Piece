15:24.071 --> 15:25.571
<b>It's Fluffy Island!</b>

15:25.571 --> 15:27.451
<b><i>Rero</i>!</b>

15:27.451 --> 15:31.461
<b>We're almost there!
Show your manliness, guys!</b>

15:31.461 --> 15:35.381
<b>Yeah!</b>

15:36.691 --> 15:40.071
<b>12:45 AM</b>

15:42.491 --> 15:45.321
<b>ON THE SEA - THE SUNNY</b>

15:49.971 --> 15:53.101
<b>Seems like they stopped attacking.</b>

15:53.101 --> 15:55.401
<b>But we still can't lose them!</b>

15:55.401 --> 15:57.981
<b>There is an ambush at Cacao Island.</b>

15:57.981 --> 16:02.531
<b>They'll probably start attacking again there
to sandwich us!</b>

16:02.531 --> 16:05.321
<b>What?! What should we do?!</b>

16:06.201 --> 16:08.241
<b>I have no choice.</b>

16:08.241 --> 16:11.831
<b>I'll negotiate with that big woman!</b>

16:13.711 --> 16:16.081
<b>Excuse me! Could I see your panties...</b>

16:16.491 --> 16:18.791
<b>Cut it out, you silly skeleton!</b>

16:20.751 --> 16:23.921
<b>Okay... The negotiation failed.</b>

16:25.591 --> 16:28.801
<b>We can make it there by 1 AM as we promised!</b>

16:30.141 --> 16:34.311
<b>But my concern is Brulee,
the key to escaping the Mirroworld.</b>

16:34.311 --> 16:39.191
<b>Even if Luffy wins, he can't get out of there
without Brulee!</b>

16:39.191 --> 16:43.991
<b>Luffy is not the kind of person
to carefully calculate something like that.</b>

16:43.991 --> 16:46.031
<b>That's right! He can't!</b>

16:46.031 --> 16:48.241
<b>He definitely can't! What should we do?!</b>

16:48.241 --> 16:51.831
<b>First of all, we're not sure
if he knows what time it is...</b>

16:51.831 --> 16:53.041
<b>He might not?!</b>

16:53.701 --> 16:55.811
<b>So much could go wrong...</b>

16:56.921 --> 16:59.041
<b>...but we believe in you, Luffy!</b>

17:02.781 --> 17:04.901
<b>12:47 AM</b>

17:35.371 --> 17:38.421
<b>Even when he falls, he falls forward...</b>

17:44.631 --> 17:47.171
<b>But I won...</b>

17:59.231 --> 18:01.151
<b><i>Listen carefully, Luffy!</i></b>

18:01.561 --> 18:04.361
<b>We'll get there in 10 hours at the earliest!</b>

18:04.361 --> 18:05.941
<b>Around 1 AM!</b>

18:06.321 --> 18:09.471
<b><i>So as soon as you kick that guy's ass,</i></b>

18:09.471 --> 18:14.561
<b><i>look for a mirror that leads to Cacao Island!
And we'll see you there!</i></b>

18:18.081 --> 18:20.911
<b>What time is it now?</b>

18:48.571 --> 18:50.701
<b>Are you gonna come back...</b>

18:53.321 --> 18:55.951
<b>...to take down Big Mom someday?</b>

19:00.331 --> 19:02.461
<b>Of course I am! Because I'll...</b>

19:02.461 --> 19:04.961
<b>...become the King of the Pirates!</b>

19:18.221 --> 19:21.011
<b>You're seeing quite far into the future!</b>

20:20.701 --> 20:22.911
<b>Branch... Let's go...</b>

20:24.001 --> 20:25.871
<b>What? Branch?</b>

20:26.501 --> 20:28.711
<b>She escaped!</b>

20:28.711 --> 20:32.091
<b>Oh, no! I can't get out 
of here without her...</b>

20:32.091 --> 20:33.801
<b>W-What should I do?</b>

20:35.891 --> 20:37.141
<b>I don't have time...</b>

20:37.551 --> 20:40.351
<b>Big Brother!</b>

20:41.271 --> 20:45.271
<b>Big Bro Katakuri!</b>

20:46.651 --> 20:47.611
<b>Branch!</b>

20:47.611 --> 20:50.291
<b>It's Brulee, Straw Hat!</b>

20:50.291 --> 20:53.781
<b>What kind of a dirty trick did you use
to take him down?!</b>

20:53.781 --> 20:56.411
<b>So you brought down Katakuri!</b>

20:56.411 --> 20:58.531
<b>I can't believe it! Grr!</b>

20:58.901 --> 20:59.871
<b>You are...</b>

21:03.081 --> 21:05.751
<b>My name is Mystoms!</b>

21:05.311 --> 21:07.311
<b>MYSTOMS - A MYSTERY SAVIOR</b>

21:07.631 --> 21:12.221
<b>In order to get you out of here,
I've captured Brulee and have been waiting for you!</b>

21:12.221 --> 21:13.991
<b>So you're okay...</b>

21:14.691 --> 21:15.991
<b>MYSTOMS - A MYSTERY SAVIOR</b>

21:14.721 --> 21:16.841
<b>Pekoms!</b>

21:16.361 --> 21:18.701
<b>PEKOMS</b>

21:19.011 --> 21:23.411
<b>Yeah! Big Bro Pedro sacrificed himself
to save your lives!</b>

21:23.411 --> 21:27.261
<b>I won't let you lose it here!</b>

21:27.981 --> 21:32.531
<b>Come on, Straw Hat!
Let's go to Cacao Island where your friends are!</b>

21:32.531 --> 21:35.401
<b>--Okay!
--Let go of me!</b>

21:35.511 --> 21:37.431
<b>12:50 AM</b>

21:38.071 --> 21:40.621
<b>There it is! Cacao Island!</b>

21:44.751 --> 21:46.251
<b>How many are there?!</b>

21:47.751 --> 21:49.991
<b>That's a massive fleet!</b>

21:50.631 --> 21:53.251
<b>Sanji-<i>kun</i>! How is it over there?</b>

21:54.171 --> 21:55.731
<b>Luffy's not here yet.</b>

21:56.421 --> 21:58.291
<b>Don't get close to the fleet at the shore.</b>

22:00.181 --> 22:03.471
<b>I'll bring Luffy to the ship somehow!</b>

22:06.161 --> 22:08.661
<b>12:55 AM</b>

22:09.021 --> 22:12.271
<b>Guys, are your weapons ready?!</b>

22:12.321 --> 22:15.951
<b>Yeah!</b>

22:15.951 --> 22:19.111
<b>If he's gonna come out, 
it'll be in five minutes!</b>

22:41.721 --> 22:45.621
<b>You fools! I'll make you pay for this!</b>

22:53.651 --> 22:55.611
<b>Come on now!</b>

22:55.941 --> 22:57.901
<b>Straw Hat Luffy!</b>

23:05.411 --> 23:09.391
<b><i>A huge watertight encirclement 
is waiting for Luffy!</i></b>

23:09.391 --> 23:12.611
<b><i>The Sunny enduring a barrage of bombs 
is already reaching its limits!</i></b>

23:12.611 --> 23:15.041
<b>The time of the rendezvous has finally come!</b>

23:15.361 --> 23:20.761
<b><i>Facing imminent danger,
Luffy and Pekoms take their chances at the risk of their lives!</i></b>

23:20.761 --> 23:22.051
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!

<b>"A Desperate Situation! The 
Iron-tight Entrapment of Luffy!"</b>

23:25.641 --> 23:27.821
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
