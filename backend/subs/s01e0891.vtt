11:55.981 --> 11:59.421

12:04.981 --> 12:07.891

<b>What?! What is it?!</b>

14:06.631 --> 14:08.691
<b>It looks like a giant fish!</b>

14:08.691 --> 14:10.851
<b>--Is it a shark?!
--A shark?!</b>

14:12.601 --> 14:14.101
<b>Oh no! It's coming!</b>

14:22.821 --> 14:24.491
<b>C-Carp...</b>

14:24.491 --> 14:26.401
<b>Oh my, oh my!</b>

14:28.951 --> 14:30.781
<b>It's a massive carp!</b>

14:38.921 --> 14:40.541
<b>It's a school of carp?!</b>

14:48.141 --> 14:50.141
<b>Why are carp in the sea?!</b>

14:50.441 --> 14:53.181
<b>They're freshwater fish!
How can they live here?!</b>

14:53.181 --> 14:56.381
<b>It doesn't matter!
They're monster carp anyway!</b>

14:56.381 --> 14:58.801
<b>Hey, Sanji? Are they delicious?!</b>

14:58.801 --> 15:01.481
<b>Forget about those monsters!</b>

15:02.021 --> 15:05.661
<b>Well, alternating it in baths of 
hot and cold water firms it up</b>

15:05.661 --> 15:07.711
<b>resulting in a delicious dish called <i>arai</i>.</b>

15:07.711 --> 15:09.521
<b>You can simmer it in <i>miso</i>, too.</b>

15:09.521 --> 15:12.441
<b>--Hey!
--You should just eat cultivated ones!</b>

15:12.441 --> 15:14.411
<b>That's not the issue now!</b>

15:14.581 --> 15:18.041
<b>Tempura and sweet-boiled ones are
also good.</b>

15:18.211 --> 15:20.631
<b>All right!</b>

15:21.381 --> 15:24.711
<b>We'll have a banquet with this
once we see Zoro and the others again!</b>

15:24.881 --> 15:28.521
<b>--Don't, Luffy!
--Carp have so many tiny bones!</b>

15:28.521 --> 15:31.801
<b>Who cares?!
That's not important now!</b>

15:38.391 --> 15:40.281
<b>Don't fight back!</b>

15:40.281 --> 15:44.191
<b>Of course, it fights back!
Why are you like that?!</b>

15:44.541 --> 15:48.991
<b>Sanji-<i>kun</i>! You're responsible, too!
Bring back Luffy!</b>

15:49.151 --> 15:52.621
<b>Don't worry, Nami-<i>san</i>.
He'll be fine.</b>

15:52.621 --> 15:53.741
<b>What?!</b>

15:54.201 --> 15:55.991
<b>Instead, let's protect our ship!</b>

16:17.471 --> 16:20.551
<b>The wind is strong!
Carrot, furl the sail!</b>

16:20.551 --> 16:22.851
<b>--Okay!
--I'll help!</b>

16:41.871 --> 16:46.841
<b>Look how clear the water is!
It's like water in a mountain river!</b>

16:46.841 --> 16:51.631
<b>I'd prefer it wasn't so clear!
The giant fish in the water scare me!</b>

16:51.971 --> 16:54.601
<b>What? Then, is this a river?!</b>

16:55.641 --> 16:58.141
<b>Where are those carp heading?!</b>

17:00.221 --> 17:03.011
<b>Hang on tight!
We're going with the flow!</b>

17:04.021 --> 17:05.741
<b>Is Luffy still around here?!</b>

17:13.151 --> 17:13.891
<b>What?!</b>

17:16.871 --> 17:19.781
<b>Whoa-whoa, what is that?!</b>

17:20.951 --> 17:24.831
<b>The river's flowing to the bottom of the waterfall!
How's that possible?!</b>

17:42.481 --> 17:43.731
<b>Oh yeah!</b>

17:44.351 --> 17:46.671
<b>If this waterfall is the 
reason that it's fresh water,</b>

17:46.671 --> 17:48.611
<b>a massive water source should be up there!</b>

17:49.441 --> 17:52.821
<b>Could it be that the Land 
of Wano is up there?!</b>

17:52.991 --> 17:54.111
<b>Up there...</b>

17:54.111 --> 17:58.491
<b>What?! Whaaat?! How is it possible?!</b>

18:19.761 --> 18:22.101
<b>Oh! Look at that!</b>

18:22.221 --> 18:25.711
<b>--The carp are climbing up the waterfall!
--Why?!</b>

18:33.611 --> 18:35.831
<b>Oh, carp! Oh, carp!</b>

18:36.761 --> 18:40.701
<b>A sailing ship can't do that!
We'll sink under the waterfall!</b>

18:40.701 --> 18:42.371
<b>Of course, we will!</b>

18:43.561 --> 18:44.341
<b>Luffy!</b>

18:44.791 --> 18:47.791
<b>Wow, those carp are so strong!</b>

18:47.961 --> 18:52.421
<b>--This is no time for that!
--Luffy! She says this ship's gonna sink!</b>

18:52.591 --> 18:53.961
<b>Okay, count on me!</b>

18:54.131 --> 18:54.811
<b>What?!</b>

18:56.671 --> 18:58.721
<b>Hang on tight!</b>

19:04.391 --> 19:06.351
<b>You can do it, carp!</b>

19:06.521 --> 19:08.691
<b>You've got to be kidding!</b>

19:10.731 --> 19:12.741
<b>Go!</b>

19:43.411 --> 19:46.891
<b>Look, Chobro!
We're climbing the waterfall!</b>

19:55.781 --> 19:57.991
<b>Nooo!!</b>

20:05.241 --> 20:07.751
<b>All right!</b>

20:10.871 --> 20:13.841
<b>Up we go!</b>

20:34.811 --> 20:38.681
<b>What's wrong with the sea area 
around the Land of Wano?!</b>

20:38.681 --> 20:40.111
<b>It's so chaotic!</b>

20:40.111 --> 20:43.361
<b>It really is difficult to enter...</b>

20:43.741 --> 20:46.451
<b>It was fun, wasn't it, Chobro?!</b>

20:46.621 --> 20:49.081
<b>I thought I was gonna die!</b>

20:49.411 --> 20:51.831
<b>Hey! There's the shore!</b>

20:55.921 --> 20:58.671
<b>Oh! Is that the Land of Wano?!</b>

20:59.051 --> 21:03.491
<b>We're finally... finally 
here at the Land of Wano...</b>

21:04.761 --> 21:07.461
<b>Chobro, it's the Land of Wano...</b>

21:20.571 --> 21:24.071
<b>Wow! Look at that massive whirl!</b>

21:25.411 --> 21:27.531
<b>A whirlpool!</b>

21:33.871 --> 21:35.961
<b>Luffy! Let go of those carp!</b>

21:36.131 --> 21:38.131
<b>No! They're my dinner!</b>

21:38.711 --> 21:40.881
<b>Enough already!</b>

21:42.221 --> 21:44.181
<b>Brook! Take the helm!</b>

21:44.341 --> 21:45.931
<b>Okay!</b>

21:56.651 --> 21:59.111
<b>It's no good! The current is too strong!</b>

22:04.701 --> 22:07.701
<b>Damn! We're almost there!</b>

22:09.331 --> 22:11.541
<b>We're not gonna make it this time!</b>

22:11.661 --> 22:14.251
<b>Doctorine!</b>

22:18.001 --> 22:20.281
<b>Oh? Where are my carp?</b>

22:20.281 --> 22:22.781
<b>--That's not important now!
--What?</b>

22:34.771 --> 22:38.061
<b>Oh no! We're gonna be 
caught in the whirlpool!</b>

23:10.071 --> 23:14.471
<b>I'll kick the Emperor of the Sea Kaido's ass
and open up the Land of Wano!</b>

23:14.771 --> 23:18.021
<b><i><i>The Straw Hats finally gather 
together at the Land of Wano!</i></i></b>

23:18.341 --> 23:19.841
<b><i><i>Formidable enemies are waiting for them</i></i></b>

23:19.841 --> 23:22.231
<b><i>in the country of the
