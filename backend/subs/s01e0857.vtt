<b><i>Oh, by the way,</i></b>

19:48.841 --> 19:53.011
<b><i>even if the Straw Hats arrive 
there sooner, don't worry.</i></b>

19:54.071 --> 19:58.431
<b><i>You can leave them to Big Bro Oven's troops

19:58.601 --> 20:01.921
<b>What?! Big Bro Oven's here?!</b>

20:08.151 --> 20:09.531
<b>It's Oven-<i>sama</i>!</b>

20:09.691 --> 20:10.651
<b>Oven-<i>sama</i>!</b>

<b>What do you mean I can't enter the factory?!</b>

20:14.151 --> 20:17.451
<b>That's Pudding-<i>sama</i>'s order...</b>

20:17.621 --> 20:18.781
<b>Even me?!</b>

20:18.951 --> 20:20.081
<b>Yes, no one.</b>

20:20.241 --> 20:23.521
<b>Well, if that's what my sister wants,
I'll accept.</b>

20:24.131 --> 20:27.541
<b>Then why is it so noisy 
in front of the factory?!</b>

20:27.541 --> 20:30.171
<b>What? Oh, that's because...</b>

20:30.851 --> 20:34.051
<b>Hey! Chiffon!</b>

20:34.661 --> 20:36.051
<b>He's...</b>

20:45.671 --> 20:49.021
<b>S-Stop hurting me!</b>

20:49.191 --> 20:50.941
<b>Shut up, you prowler!</b>

20:51.111 --> 20:55.201
<b>D-Don't you remember me, Oven-<i>kun</i>?!</b>

20:56.801 --> 21:00.161
<b>I remember you, my ex-stepdad.</b>

21:00.331 --> 21:05.291
<b>I-I'm happy that you remember me.</b>

21:05.601 --> 21:10.041
<b>I used to be your stepfather.</b>

21:13.811 --> 21:15.931
<b>That's why I must remove you.</b>

21:16.091 --> 21:16.931
<b>What?</b>

21:17.261 --> 21:19.571
<b>Mama will be here soon.</b>

21:19.571 --> 21:21.851
<b>Oh, Linlin will?!</b>

21:22.201 --> 21:24.141
<b>Stop calling her that!</b>

21:24.791 --> 21:27.231
<b>If she hears about this,
she'll get madder.</b>

21:27.831 --> 21:31.071
<b>So I gotta get you as far away as possible
before she comes!</b>

21:31.441 --> 21:35.321
<b>Wh-What are you gonna do...?</b>

21:35.321 --> 21:40.701
<b>I just wanna see Chiffon even

<b>Luffy-<i>kun</i> is in trouble!</b>

21:59.201 --> 22:00.221
<b>Right.</b>

22:00.391 --> 22:02.931
<b>I can't believe he's challenging Big Bro Katakuri
to a one-on-one duel.</b>

22:03.461 --> 22:05.471
<b>That's too reckless!</b>

22:05.931 --> 22:06.851
<b>I bet so.</b>

22:07.021 --> 22:11.271
<b>Big Bro Katakuri is a superhuman!
