the Red-bean Baum Cake Meeting Room!</b>

18:04.951 --> 18:08.321
<b><i>Not just a crack! It broke up!</i></b>

18:08.711 --> 18:11.821
<b>This is the Red-bean Baum Cake third floor!
What's happening?!</b>

18:12.351 --> 18:14.881
<b>The room is starting to slant!</b>

18:14.881 --> 18:16.631
<b><i>It's not an earthquake!</i></b>

18:17.751 --> 18:20.801
<b>I clearly heard a big explosion earlier!</b>

18:20.801 --> 18:23.801
<b>--Is it an enemy attack?!
--It keeps leaning!</b>

18:23.801 --> 18:25.551
<b>What's going on?</b>

18:26.721 --> 18:28.341
<b>No way...</b>

18:29.431 --> 18:31.721
<b>It's falling over-<i>bon</i>...</b>

18:33.021 --> 18:35.261
<b>The Whole Cake Chateau!</b>

18:36.311 --> 18:39.811
<b>It's falling over-<i>bon</i>!</b>

18:39.961 --> 18:42.311
<b>Cock-a-doodle-do!</b>

18:42.541 --> 18:46.801
<b>SWEET CITY, THE CAPITAL</b>

18:50.871 --> 18:52.461
<b>Was it our enemy's cannon?!</b>

18:52.461 --> 18:57.041
<b>This is the Emperor of the Sea's stronghold!
How can anyone invade this island?!</b>

18:57.041 --> 18:59.251
<b>So it really was an explosion?!</b>

19:02.191 --> 19:04.681
<b>What caused the blast?!</b>

19:04.681 --> 19:06.431
<b>Stop falling!</b>

19:06.431 --> 19:08.261
<b>Everyone's gonna die!</b>

19:08.391 --> 19:11.681
<b>Does it have something to do with
the wedding on the rooftop?!</b>

19:28.781 --> 19:30.531
<b>This has to be a joke!</b>

19:31.991 --> 19:34.491
<b>But this is big news!</b>

19:39.501 --> 19:41.621
<b>Was that what I think it was?</b>

19:42.011 --> 19:42.871
<b>I think so!</b>

19:44.461 --> 19:48.171
<b>The timing was dead-on!
What else could have caused it?</b>

19:49.161 --> 19:52.551
<b>But... why the Tamate Box?!</b>

19:55.561 --> 19:57.391
<b>Guys, hold onto something!</b>

20:00.021 --> 20:01.771
<b>Where are Straw Hat and the others?</b>

20:03.111 --> 20:04.991
<b>What is all this?</b>

20:04.991 --> 20:06.711
<b>I don't know...</b>

20:06.711 --> 20:10.881
<b>But it saved us anyway!
Otherwise, all of us would've been killed.</b>

20:17.041 --> 20:20.761
<b>What's going on?! What's happening?!</b>

20:33.391 --> 20:35.351
<b>Something saved us...</b>

20:36.101 --> 20:38.351
<b>We don't know if we've been...</b>

20:40.101 --> 20:41.881
<b>...saved or not, yet!</b>

20:42.731 --> 20:44.771
<b>We're in big trouble, Mama!</b>

20:45.191 --> 20:51.071
<b><i>The Whole Cake Chateau is crumbling now
due to an unknown explosion!</i></b>

21:04.581 --> 21:06.461
<b>Something's going on outside!</b>

21:06.461 --> 21:09.541
<b>We don't feel anything in Bege's body though!</b>

21:09.941 --> 21:11.591
<b>What is happening?</b>

21:13.591 --> 21:16.591
<b>I don't know. But...</b>

21:16.741 --> 21:19.471
<b>...the place is in chaos now.</b>

21:21.101 --> 21:22.341
<b>Could it be...</b>

21:22.871 --> 21:26.561
<b>...that the Whole Cake Chateau is shaking?!</b>

21:27.731 --> 21:29.401
<b>What kind of joke is this?!</b>

21:29.401 --> 21:32.071
<b>Am I dreaming?</b>

21:34.571 --> 21:36.031
<b>Look, Caesar!</b>

21:38.121 --> 21:40.371
<b>It's a big mess....</b>

21:43.391 --> 21:45.391
<b>How did it happen?!</b>

21:46.631 --> 21:49.631
<b>Who did it and what did they do?!</b>

21:50.031 --> 21:50.991
<b>Big Brothers...</b>

21:51.921 --> 21:53.161
<b>Big Sisters...</b>

21:54.381 --> 21:56.421
<b>Oh my brothers and sisters!</b>

21:59.311 --> 22:01.141
<b>I can't stop!</b>

22:01.291 --> 22:02.261
<b>Mama!</b>

22:22.831 --> 22:26.201
<b>Mama!!</b>

22:41.521 --> 22:43.391
<b>Terrific!</b>

22:44.181 --> 22:47.871
<b>I don't know who did it
but I gotta thank them!</b>

22:47.871 --> 22:50.441
<b>We didn't have to kill her!</b>

22:51.231 --> 22:52.701
<b>Now,</b>

22:53.211 --> 22:56.551
<b>the "Emperor of the Sea" Big 
Mom Pirates have been...</b>

22:56.551 --> 22:58.821
<b>...annihilated!</b>

23:09.711 --> 23:12.421
<b><i><i>The giant chateau that is bigger
