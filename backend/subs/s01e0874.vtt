13:48.651 --> 13:53.781
<b>I'm doing this because I believe in the cake
made by Black-Leg.</b>

13:54.321 --> 13:57.181
<b>I don't know who he learned from,</b>

13:57.181 --> 14:01.451
<b>but his cooking skill might be higher
than the Executive Chef's!</b>

14:03.541 --> 14:05.211
<b>It's so delicious!</b>

14:06.371 --> 14:10.961
<b>Mama's Hunger Pangs attack
will stop here!</b>

14:21.601 --> 14:22.771
<b>Vito! Gotti!</b>

14:23.601 --> 14:27.211
<b>Go look for a ship to escape now!</b>

14:27.211 --> 14:30.031
<b>I'll take Chiffon with me later!</b>

14:30.031 --> 14:32.201
<b>O-Okay-<i>rero</i>!</b>

14:32.201 --> 14:33.561
<b>Got it!</b>

14:33.561 --> 14:36.381
<b>We paid off our debt to the Straw Hats.</b>

14:36.381 --> 14:38.901
<b>We lost our precious ship.</b>

14:38.901 --> 14:41.261
<b>Those fools of the Straw Hats!</b>

14:41.261 --> 14:44.991
<b>I won't forgive them if they die
after all we've done for them!</b>

14:55.131 --> 14:57.471
<b>Wedding...</b>

15:04.931 --> 15:08.641
<b>...cake!!</b>

15:55.941 --> 15:57.191
<b>Fire!</b>

16:09.331 --> 16:10.331
<b>Huh?</b>

16:10.331 --> 16:11.501
<b>What the...?</b>

16:17.881 --> 16:20.131
<b>Germa's backing them up!</b>

16:20.131 --> 16:22.051
<b>Damn you, Judge!</b>

16:22.721 --> 16:24.341
<b>Should we return fire?!</b>

16:24.341 --> 16:26.281
<b>No, don't bother!</b>

16:26.281 --> 16:29.891
<b>Germa is also fighting 
the fleet at the harbor!</b>

16:29.891 --> 16:32.691
<b>--Aim at Straw Hat's ship!
--Yes, ma'am!</b>

17:05.091 --> 17:09.181
<b>What's so good about him?! Straw Hat Luffy!</b>

17:11.101 --> 17:14.481
<b>This is Emperor of the Sea 
Big Mom's territory...</b>

17:14.481 --> 17:17.561
<b>Once you enter,
you'll never be able to get out!</b>

17:17.561 --> 17:22.031
<b>You risked your life
just to get him back?!</b>

17:26.951 --> 17:30.411
<b>Sanji is Germa's failure!</b>

17:31.951 --> 17:35.371
<b>His skin doesn't work as a shield!</b>

17:37.251 --> 17:42.211
<b>He works as a cook
because he has no pride in his royal blood!</b>

17:43.381 --> 17:44.511
<b>Uh-huh...</b>

17:45.131 --> 17:47.931
<b>He's easily moved like an idiot</b>

17:48.971 --> 17:55.271
<b>and his soft mind makes him
put his life on the line for the weak!</b>

17:55.271 --> 18:00.211
<b>A failed soldier who is far from perfect...</b>

18:00.211 --> 18:02.901
<b>That's all he is!</b>

18:34.311 --> 18:36.891
<b>Goodbye! Thank you for your help!</b>

18:37.651 --> 18:40.631
<b>Why don't you say something?!</b>

18:40.631 --> 18:43.151
<b>Straw Hat!</b>

18:44.651 --> 18:50.161
<b>I'm surprised. Why did he suddenly start listing
all the good things about you?</b>

18:50.161 --> 18:53.911
<b>What?! He didn't mean it that way!</b>

18:53.911 --> 18:55.201
<b>What?!</b>

18:58.581 --> 19:00.871
<b>You guys are amazing!</b>

19:00.871 --> 19:02.011
<b>Why's that?</b>

19:02.011 --> 19:03.921
<b>Why? Tell us!</b>

19:19.231 --> 19:20.941
<b>Nami! Look forward!</b>

19:20.941 --> 19:22.151
<b>What?</b>

19:30.191 --> 19:32.321
<b>No! Oh, please!</b>

19:33.741 --> 19:36.871
<b>Jimbei! There is a massive fleet ahead!</b>

19:37.541 --> 19:39.291
<b>When did they arrive?!</b>

19:40.291 --> 19:42.171
<b>They finally noticed!</b>

19:43.631 --> 19:45.041
<b>There are tons of ships!</b>

19:45.041 --> 19:47.921
<b>Oh, no! We got sandwiched again!</b>

19:48.151 --> 19:52.111
<b>GERMA                          THE SUNNY</b>

19:48.761 --> 19:52.261
<b>All their available ships 
came around the island!</b>

19:52.971 --> 19:54.931
<b>We're surrounded!</b>

20:01.651 --> 20:04.561
<b>We're already in their attack range!</b>

20:04.561 --> 20:06.111
<b>How is it possible?!</b>

20:06.571 --> 20:08.111
<b>That's right!</b>

20:08.111 --> 20:11.281
<b>We're coming from both the 
front and back, rabbit!</b>

20:11.611 --> 20:12.611
<b>Carrot-<i>chan</i>!</b>

20:12.611 --> 20:16.321
<b>You're between the fleet and the genie!</b>

20:16.321 --> 20:17.371
<b>Genie-uine...</b>

20:18.331 --> 20:19.871
<b>...Rage Split!</b>

20:20.461 --> 20:21.461
<b>Black-Leg?!</b>

20:22.001 --> 20:22.881
<b>Sanji!</b>

20:25.421 --> 20:27.091
<b>There's a giant one!</b>

20:29.841 --> 20:34.261
<b>We finally got close enough
for my power to reach!</b>

20:34.641 --> 20:38.271
<b>Now it looks like we're bullying them.</b>

20:40.561 --> 20:42.981
<b>How did they suddenly get this close?!</b>

20:42.981 --> 20:45.731
<b>Look closely at the ships in front of us!</b>

20:49.941 --> 20:53.071
<b>They're all paddle ships!</b>

20:54.241 --> 20:57.111
<b>--No way!
--We can't get clear away then!</b>

20:57.111 --> 21:02.331
<b>This might be it for us!
Even though we struggled so much to make it this far...</b>

21:02.331 --> 21:04.291
<b>Crush them all at once!</b>

21:06.211 --> 21:07.301
<b>Go!</b>

21:07.301 --> 21:12.251
<b>They're already trapped like rats!
Just sink them!</b>

21:29.071 --> 21:31.941
<b>The Straw Hats will be swallowed by the sea!</b>

21:34.321 --> 21:35.701
<b>What?!</b>

21:35.701 --> 21:37.161
<b>What's going on?!</b>

21:47.081 --> 21:49.301
<b>The sea surface is lifting up...</b>

21:50.501 --> 21:56.511
<b>Those who trouble Boss...</b>

21:57.511 --> 22:03.021
<b>I won't forgive!</b>

22:11.521 --> 22:13.241
<b>What?!</b>

22:13.241 --> 22:16.911
<b>He's a member of Hordy's group

22:20.161 --> 22:20.991
<b>What?</b>

22:21.371 --> 22:22.291
<b>No way!</b>

22:22.701 --> 22:24.081
<b>Jimbei!</b>

22:29.211 --> 22:30.631
<b>You guys!</b>

22:35.471 --> 22:39.871
<b>We came to say goodbye! Captain Jimbei!</b>

22:39.871 --> 22:42.681
<b>No, "former"! Former Captain!</b>

22:49.391 --> 22:55.191
<b>Until we leave this territory,
