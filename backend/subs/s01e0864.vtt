<b>Count on us!</b>

16:50.281 --> 16:51.991
<b>I'm sorry but...</b>

16:52.041 --> 16:56.121
<b>...Big Mom will stand up again in no time!</b>

16:59.541 --> 17:01.841
<b>--How's Carrot?
--She's okay!</b>

17:02.961 --> 17:05.421
<b>Let's lose them at full speed!</b>

17:10.261 --> 17:12.721
<b>Mama, are you okay?</b>

17:12.891 --> 17:13.851
<b>Yeah!</b>

17:17.851 --> 17:21.231
<b>That wasn't so bad, Jimbei!</b>

17:21.981 --> 17:23.031
<b>Here she comes!</b>

17:23.321 --> 17:26.991
<b>Oh! I have an idea!</b>

17:30.161 --> 17:32.031
<b>I'll slice it up!</b>

17:32.201 --> 17:34.451
<b>That's a good idea, Mama!</b>

17:34.621 --> 17:38.211
<b>Then, I'm sure I'll find it!</b>

17:40.171 --> 17:42.381
<b>The wedding cake!</b>

17:42.541 --> 17:46.011
<b>It extended this time!
If she swings it around...</b>

17:46.171 --> 17:48.341
<b>The ship will be finished!</b>

17:48.511 --> 17:51.351
<b>At least she's not on the ship anymore!</b>

17:51.351 --> 17:53.611
<b>Alright, Zeus-<i>chan</i>...</b>

17:55.021 --> 17:56.481
<b>You like them, right?</b>

17:58.191 --> 17:59.401
<b>Those are...!</b>

17:59.851 --> 18:01.261
<b>Black Ball!</b>

18:04.861 --> 18:08.821
<b>It's delicious! It's 
delicious! So delicious!!</b>

18:11.201 --> 18:13.621
<b>Yum-yum!</b>

18:13.781 --> 18:16.751
<b>That's right! Now, help yourself!</b>

18:16.911 --> 18:19.331
<b>What should I do?!</b>

18:19.331 --> 18:22.921
<b>Humph! The same trick doesn't work twice!</b>

18:25.631 --> 18:29.971
<b>Don't try to fool me, you temptress!</b>

18:30.381 --> 18:32.261
<b>Nami!</b>

18:36.931 --> 18:38.311
<b>It's me.</b>

18:38.521 --> 18:40.101
<b>Oh, please!</b>

18:46.401 --> 18:51.031
<b>That's right... I don't have any flesh
so lightning doesn't affect me.</b>

18:51.911 --> 18:53.951
<b>Oh?</b>

18:53.951 --> 18:58.161
<b>Do you wanna fight me, Soul King?!</b>

18:59.461 --> 19:02.921
<b>I'm sorry that I don't know when to give up!</b>

19:14.681 --> 19:15.761
<b>No way!</b>

19:19.561 --> 19:22.271
<b>How hard her skin is!</b>

19:27.231 --> 19:33.111
<b>I remember that you couldn't even 
make a scratch on me with your sword!</b>

19:33.821 --> 19:37.701
<b>You're right... So could I at least...</b>

19:37.741 --> 19:41.831
<b>...see your panties?!</b>

19:46.791 --> 19:49.001
<b>Huh?!</b>

19:49.001 --> 19:50.631
<b>What?!</b>

20:02.561 --> 20:03.391
<b>Okay.</b>

20:03.851 --> 20:06.361
<b>It's done!</b>

20:06.901 --> 20:09.491
<b>Three-Pace Hum...</b>

20:09.821 --> 20:11.931
<b>...Soul...</b>

20:13.901 --> 20:15.531
<b>...Notch Slash!</b>

20:19.121 --> 20:23.831
<b>Our only target was you, Zeus!</b>

20:23.831 --> 20:27.171
<b>Ow, ow, ow! Damn!
I let my guard down!</b>

20:27.331 --> 20:29.211
<b>Stay with us, Zeus!</b>

20:33.671 --> 20:36.551
<b>Positive Charge Black Ball!</b>

20:36.551 --> 20:40.721
<b>Discharge and feel better, Zeus-<i>chan</i>!</b>

20:40.971 --> 20:42.561
<b>You...!</b>

20:44.311 --> 20:47.021
<b>Th-This is...</b>

20:49.021 --> 20:50.151
<b>What is it?!</b>

21:14.471 --> 21:16.931
<b>Unstoppable Mochi Blade Bullets!</b>

22:03.851 --> 22:07.021
<b>You're holding your own 
against me for this long...</b>

22:07.061 --> 22:11.051
<b>I admit you have quite a lot of prowess,
Straw Hat.</b>

22:11.861 --> 22:16.761
<b>But no matter how hard you try,
you can't beat me.</b>

22:18.951 --> 22:21.231
<b>Unstoppable Donuts!</b>

22:26.581 --> 22:29.081
<b>Damn, it's the technique he used before!</b>

22:29.581 --> 22:35.051
<b>I almost... I almost can see his next move...</b>

22:35.251 --> 22:37.751
<b>I can see it, Straw Hat...</b>

22:43.551 --> 22:46.351
<b>Your future is in darkness!</b>

22:46.771 --> 22:47.991
<b>Nine-headed Mochi!</b>

22:48.481 --> 22:49.981
<b>Shut up!</b>

22:54.441 --> 22:56.321
<b>My future is...</b>

22:56.941 --> 22:58.931
<b>...mine to decide!</b>

23:09.621 --> 23:11.371
<b><i><i>Luffy still can't see the future and

23:11.371 --> 23:14.021

of Katakuri's fierce attacks!</i></b>

23:14.021 --> 23:17.181
<b><i><i>There seems to be no chance

23:17.631 --> 23:20.801
<b><i><i>However, when Luffy gives an enraged war cry</i></i></b>

<b><i>and the memory of Rayleigh returns,
