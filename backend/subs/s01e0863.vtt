16:08.781 --> 16:10.361
<b>He-<i>teia</i> saved me the work!</b>

16:10.531 --> 16:12.331
<b>We'll get her this time!</b>

16:44.361 --> 16:45.481
<b>Genie...!</b>

16:46.691 --> 16:47.861
<b>Carrot-<i>san</i>!</b>

16:50.031 --> 16:51.781
<b>Guillotine!</b>

16:54.371 --> 16:56.991
<b>Go to hell, brat!</b>

16:57.621 --> 17:02.461
<b><i>I'm sorry, Pedro...
I guess this is it for me...</i></b>

17:03.171 --> 17:07.001
<b><i>I hope I helped Luffy and the others...</i></b>

17:07.051 --> 17:09.261
<b><i>...even a little bit.</i></b>

17:23.101 --> 17:24.731
<b>Baron Corpse!</b>

17:24.901 --> 17:26.861
<b>I'm glad that you're okay!</b>

17:26.901 --> 17:31.321
<b>To the best of my poor ability,
I put everyone on the other ship to sleep!</b>

17:31.361 --> 17:34.871
<b>You've already done enough.
Let's go back!</b>

17:37.241 --> 17:39.621
<b>You saved me! Thank you!</b>

17:39.791 --> 17:41.251
<b>No, thank <i>you</i>!</b>

17:41.961 --> 17:44.131
<b>How do you turn back?</b>

17:44.291 --> 17:48.711
<b>I can change back by shading my eyes
from the moonlight.</b>

17:49.841 --> 17:54.891
<b>Hats or shades...
Or simply by closing my eyes...</b>

17:55.891 --> 18:00.061
<b>Full moonlight raises our spirits!</b>

18:00.351 --> 18:03.061
<b>You were really beautiful!</b>

18:07.521 --> 18:09.861
<b>Carrot... Are you alright?!</b>

18:11.111 --> 18:11.861
<b>Yeah...</b>

18:12.321 --> 18:16.621
<b>Thank you!
You helped us out of a tight spot!</b>

18:16.661 --> 18:20.831
<b>We were surrounded by the enemies
and our ship was almost sunk!</b>

18:21.161 --> 18:25.331
<b>Well done! That's my little sister, Carrot!</b>

18:27.171 --> 18:29.801
<b>I'm happy that I could help.</b>

18:29.841 --> 18:34.091
<b>Can I stay in a room where I can't see the moon?</b>

18:34.881 --> 18:39.761
<b>Of course! Leave it to us
and get some rest!</b>

18:39.931 --> 18:42.431
<b>Oh, before you go,
could I see your panties...</b>

18:43.851 --> 18:45.191
<b>Quit it!</b>

18:49.521 --> 18:53.071
<b>Big Bro Peros!
Big Bro Daifuku can't fight anymore!</b>

18:53.111 --> 18:55.241
<b>His fleet is drifting away!</b>

18:55.491 --> 18:59.201
<b>How useless Daifuku is!</b>

19:02.291 --> 19:05.411
<b>Mama... Are you really alright?!</b>

19:11.051 --> 19:12.171
<b>There they are...</b>

19:12.341 --> 19:14.171
<b>They're coming, Mama!</b>

19:15.801 --> 19:17.801
<b>Zeus! Prometheus!</b>

19:17.971 --> 19:20.351
<b>We're on our way!</b>

19:25.061 --> 19:27.231
<b>M-Mama?! She's like a different person...</b>

19:27.401 --> 19:31.401
<b>She moved like a feather...
Is that because she got too hungry?!</b>

19:33.441 --> 19:39.411
<b>Lick. How many years has it been
since the last time I saw Mama move so swiftly?!</b>

19:40.321 --> 19:43.871
<b>Give me the wedding cake!</b>

19:44.041 --> 19:46.501
<b>Big Mom is coming!</b>

19:49.291 --> 19:51.041
<b>Napoleon!</b>

19:51.421 --> 19:53.711
<b>Transform into a sword!</b>

19:54.261 --> 19:56.091
<b>Yes, Mama!</b>

20:12.361 --> 20:14.071
<b>What the hell is that?!</b>

20:14.231 --> 20:15.821
<b>Mama...</b>

20:18.241 --> 20:21.281
<b>Straw Hat!</b>

20:41.471 --> 20:43.011
<b>No way!</b>

20:44.811 --> 20:46.561
<b>Big Mom!</b>

20:47.811 --> 20:50.021
<b>What did she turn into?!</b>

20:52.981 --> 20:56.651
<b>Where's my wedding cake?</b>

20:58.361 --> 21:03.741
<b>Stand back, guys!
Get ready to even abandon the ship!</b>

21:04.621 --> 21:05.701
<b>But...</b>

21:06.911 --> 21:11.541
<b>Oh... I'm so hungry.</b>

21:11.581 --> 21:17.001
<b>But nothing else can satisfy me.</b>

21:17.051 --> 21:18.011
<b>Where is it?!</b>

21:22.131 --> 21:26.011
<b>Where is the wedding cake?!</b>

21:26.391 --> 21:29.311
<b>--No! The Sunny...!
--Oh, no!</b>

21:29.481 --> 21:32.771
<b>How can we kick out such a monster?!</b>

21:47.411 --> 21:49.701
<b>Unstoppable Donuts!</b>

21:57.291 --> 21:58.671
<b>Nine-headed Mochi!</b>

22:01.261 --> 22:02.761
<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

22:08.561 --> 22:11.891
<b><i>Haki becomes even stronger...</i></b>

22:11.931 --> 22:14.271
<b>...in the heat of actual battle.</b>

22:22.241 --> 22:24.951
<b><i>The more you face tough enemies,</i></b>

22:24.991 --> 22:27.661
<b><i>the stronger you'll be.</i></b>

22:50.601 --> 22:52.311
<b>What are you doing?</b>

23:09.741 --> 23:13.451
<b><i>Mom catches up to the Straw Hats
who are trying desperately to get away!</i></b>

23:13.501 --> 23:17.421
<b><i>She destroys everything she can!
The Sunny catches fire!</i></b>

23:17.461 --> 23:25.341
<b><i>But that is when Jimbei's Fish-Man Karate technique blasts off!
The battle between the Straw Hats and Mom now begins!</i></b>

23:25.511 --> 23:29.851
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"Finally, They Clash! The Emperor of the Sea vs. the Straw Hats!"</b>

23:29.891 --> 23:34.141
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
