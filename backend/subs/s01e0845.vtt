Your fiancee's waiting for you, isn't she?!</b>

17:20.041 --> 17:21.501
<b>He can't move! Let's get off!</b>

17:35.021 --> 17:36.021
<b>Run!</b>

17:36.181 --> 17:37.351
<b>Nami! This way!</b>

17:37.521 --> 17:38.481
<b>Nami-<i>san</i>!</b>

17:38.641 --> 17:40.351
<b>You-<i>gara</i> will get hurt, too!</b>

17:40.521 --> 17:41.901
<b>Nami!</b>

18:03.541 --> 18:04.881
<b>Tree!</b>

18:07.131 --> 18:08.841
<b>Kingbaum...</b>

18:09.931 --> 18:10.891
<b>Nami-<i>san</i>!</b>

18:37.081 --> 18:42.251
<b>Wedding cake!</b>

18:46.551 --> 18:47.551
<b>Where's Bege?</b>

18:47.711 --> 18:49.551
<b><i>We'll catch up to him soon!</i></b>

18:49.721 --> 18:52.471
<b>There's a fire in the Seducing Woods...</b>

18:51.301 --> 18:54.601
<b>SWEET CITY, THE CAPITAL</b>

18:52.641 --> 18:54.601
<b><i>I think Mama is fighting.</i></b>

18:55.681 --> 18:58.641
<b>This is the Mirroworld. Montd'Or!</b>

18:58.811 --> 19:03.851
<b>We have 10,000 soldiers
who are waiting to be sent anytime anywhere!</b>

19:06.901 --> 19:09.531
<b>Got it. We'll be in touch.</b>

19:10.071 --> 19:13.451
<b>Candy. Biscuit. Nuts.</b>

19:13.491 --> 19:18.701
<b><i>Battleships from those islands, keep an eye on
the southwest coast where the Straw Hats' ship is moored</i></b>

19:18.741 --> 19:21.001
<b><i>and don't let them raise anchor!</i></b>

19:21.161 --> 19:22.041
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

19:22.211 --> 19:26.211
<b>Your encirclement will be
the first hurdle for them.</b>

19:26.461 --> 19:31.591
<b>Tart ships from Flavor Island
and Liqueur Island will follow that.</b>

19:31.631 --> 19:35.261
<b><i>Get ready and stand by at the port.</i></b>

19:35.301 --> 19:38.681
<b><i>Wait for the Warning Signals
from the Territory Slugs.</i></b>

19:38.851 --> 19:40.021
<b><i>Roger.</i></b>

19:42.601 --> 19:48.151
<b>They can't get away from the security network of
the Territory Slugs.</b>

19:48.901 --> 19:52.781
<b>SOUTHWEST COAST - THE SUNNY</b>

19:53.071 --> 19:54.741
<b>It's noisy in the forest.</b>

19:54.911 --> 19:56.451
<b>No wonder...</b>

19:58.161 --> 20:04.621
<b>Mama is going after them herself
so there is zero chance for them to make it here.</b>

20:05.171 --> 20:06.291
<b>I bet so.</b>

20:06.461 --> 20:10.211
<b>Well, then, why are we setting up an ambush?</b>

20:11.171 --> 20:12.881
<b>Just in case.</b>

20:19.181 --> 20:22.021
<b>They're coming after us with the Tart Tanks!</b>

20:22.181 --> 20:23.391
<b>Fire!</b>

20:26.601 --> 20:30.571
<b>We'll get to the coast soon!
They can't catch us!</b>

20:31.981 --> 20:33.281
<b>Brother Bege!</b>

20:33.571 --> 20:35.491
<b>Wow! You scared me!</b>

20:36.781 --> 20:41.741
<b>Pudding-<i>sa</i>... I mean, Pudding!
Even if you're a young girl, I'm not gonna show mercy!</b>

20:41.911 --> 20:46.251
<b>I've got to talk to Big Sis Chiffon!
Let me see her now!</b>

20:48.331 --> 20:50.381
<b>Big Sis Chiffon! Where are you?</b>

20:53.131 --> 20:55.171
<b>Pudding! What brings you here?!</b>

20:55.341 --> 20:56.381
<b>Big Sis!</b>

20:56.841 --> 20:59.301
<b>I need your help!</b>

20:59.721 --> 21:02.931
<b>Mama's having another Hunger Pang attack!</b>

21:03.431 --> 21:06.391
<b>She's craving a wedding cake!</b>

21:07.061 --> 21:09.111
<b>Hunger Pang attack?!</b>

21:09.271 --> 21:13.981
<b>Yes, and the wedding cake she wants
is a chocolate chiffon cake!</b>

21:14.031 --> 21:16.531
<b>I guess that's enough information for you.</b>

21:18.571 --> 21:21.701
<b>So you need my chiffon cake.</b>

21:21.871 --> 21:28.211
<b>If we combine my chocolate
and your chiffon cake,</b>

21:28.251 --> 21:32.041
<b>we can make a wedding cake
that will satisfy Mama!</b>

21:32.091 --> 21:36.381
<b>If we let her eat it,
we can stop her attack!</b>

21:43.681 --> 21:45.471
<b>I'm sorry, Pudding...</b>

21:45.521 --> 21:49.151
<b>I'm leaving this country just like Lola.</b>

21:49.191 --> 21:53.111
<b>I no longer care what happens to Mama
or to this country!</b>

21:53.271 --> 21:56.191
<b>Yeah! So just go away, Pudding!</b>

21:56.361 --> 21:57.651
<b>It's not that...</b>

22:04.871 --> 22:07.711
<b>My real purpose is...</b>

22:07.751 --> 22:11.081
<b>...not to save Mama or this country, either!</b>

22:31.811 --> 22:34.191
<b>Oh, good boy, good boy.</b>

22:51.421 --> 22:54.541
<b>I need to stop Mama as soon as possible...</b>

22:56.631 --> 22:58.171
<b>Otherwise, he...</b>

22:58.211 --> 23:01.881
<b>...and his friends will get killed!</b>

23:09.481 --> 23:13.101
<b><i>Luffy and the others are confused by
the shifting ways of the Seducing Woods!</i></b>

23:13.151 --> 23:19.071
<b><i>However, in the midst of the scramble,
the untamed warrior Pedro's lightning speed,</i></b>

23:19.111 --> 23:25.741
<b><i>and Nami's magic cast from her new weapon,
the Sorcerer's Climate Baton, will clear their way!</i></b>

23:25.911 --> 23:30.331
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"A Lightning Counterattack! Nami and Zeus the Thundercloud!"</b>

23:30.371 --> 23:33.371
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
