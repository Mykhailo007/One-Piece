16:17.251 --> 16:19.361
<b>Be careful, Sanji.</b>

16:18.821 --> 16:23.111
<b>THE SUNNY</b>

16:19.361 --> 16:20.201
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:20.201 --> 16:23.261
<b>D-Don't come close! Stay away! Sanji...</b>

16:23.261 --> 16:24.771
<b>...<i>san</i>!</b>

16:24.771 --> 16:29.121
<b>I'll leave the Sunny to you guys!
We're entering the crucial stage!</b>

16:29.121 --> 16:30.101
<b>Yeah!</b>

16:30.101 --> 16:32.911
<b>Pudding-<i>chan</i>, take me to Cacao Island.</b>

16:32.911 --> 16:37.941
<b>Don't tell me what to do!
You can't act like a bossy husband!</b>

16:37.941 --> 16:39.261
<b>Sanji!</b>

16:39.841 --> 16:41.461
<b>...<i>San</i>!</b>

16:41.461 --> 16:43.611
<b>Oh? What was that?</b>

16:43.611 --> 16:46.841
<b>--Carrot!
--Are you okay now?!</b>

16:46.841 --> 16:50.691
<b>I'm sorry, everyone... I was sleeping.</b>

16:50.691 --> 16:54.501
<b>No need to apologize!
You did great, Little Sis!</b>

16:56.231 --> 17:01.521
<b>Does that happen to Cat Viper and Dogstorm, too,
when they see the full moon, Little Sis?!</b>

17:01.521 --> 17:02.961
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

17:02.961 --> 17:08.451
<b>Both Master Cat Viper and Duke Dogstorm
can become way stronger than me!</b>

17:08.451 --> 17:10.301
<b>Yeah?!</b>

17:22.111 --> 17:25.641
<b>Watch and tell me which direction
their attacks come from!</b>

17:25.641 --> 17:26.651
<b>Got it!</b>

17:26.841 --> 17:29.151
<b>No!</b>

17:42.881 --> 17:45.501
<b>I need more and more liquid.</b>

17:47.071 --> 17:50.791
<b>You hurt your own men!
You're going too far!</b>

17:51.721 --> 17:54.771
<b>The Straw Hats! I won't let them get away!</b>

17:54.951 --> 17:56.131
<b>What's that?!</b>

17:56.131 --> 17:58.981
<b>Is she a Giant?</b>

17:58.981 --> 18:01.401
<b>Could I see your panties...</b>

18:01.611 --> 18:03.611
<b>Stop it! You perverted skeleton!</b>

18:06.321 --> 18:07.321
<b>It's coming again!</b>

18:07.321 --> 18:08.491
<b>Dodge to the right!</b>

18:13.781 --> 18:15.691
<b>Again, to the right!</b>

18:20.921 --> 18:22.671
<b>Jimbei, to the left!</b>

18:26.091 --> 18:27.671
<b>Damn Jimbei!</b>

18:35.471 --> 18:39.811
<b>Stay alert! I'm depending on your directions!</b>

18:40.791 --> 18:42.171
<b>Count on us!</b>

18:42.171 --> 18:45.011
<b>Don't worry! I'll take responsibility!</b>

18:45.011 --> 18:48.561
<b>Oh, she became even bigger!</b>

18:54.201 --> 18:57.371
<b>Smoothie! This ship can't hold up!</b>

18:57.681 --> 19:00.611
<b>This will sink them!</b>

19:01.231 --> 19:02.171
<b>It's coming!</b>

19:09.301 --> 19:11.301
<b>That's so big!</b>

19:11.301 --> 19:13.051
<b>It'll sink us!</b>

19:13.051 --> 19:15.351
<b>Dodge to the right, Jimbei!</b>

19:35.571 --> 19:38.871
<b>Everyone, hang on tight!</b>

19:38.871 --> 19:42.241
<b>Tsk! They're so persistent!</b>

20:05.771 --> 20:07.761
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

20:08.091 --> 20:11.971
<b>I didn't notice even one of her needles...
I was foolish, too.</b>

20:12.341 --> 20:17.311
<b>Fairness isn't a given in a pirate fight...</b>

20:19.431 --> 20:22.291
<b>It's my fault because I couldn't dodge them!</b>

21:13.651 --> 21:15.801
<b>I no longer think...</b>

21:15.801 --> 21:19.381
<b>...that you're that much weaker than me.</b>

21:19.551 --> 21:22.261
<b>Oh, really?! I'm glad!</b>

21:22.261 --> 21:23.961
<b>Thank you!</b>

21:26.501 --> 21:27.481
<b>But...</b>

21:30.711 --> 21:31.731
<b>...I'll win!</b>

23:05.181 --> 23:09.371
<b><i>Luffy desperately tries to keep up with Katakuri
but he still can't strike back.</i></b>

23:09.371 --> 23:14.041
<b><i>The tables are turning against him
and he is under attack by Katakuri!</i></b>

23:14.041 --> 23:20.761
<b><i>Will he be able to awaken his true ability
and land a full-power blow?!</i></b>

23:20.761 --> 23:25.181
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"Wake Up! The Color of Observation Able to Top the Strongest!"</b>

23:25.181 --> 23:28.841
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
