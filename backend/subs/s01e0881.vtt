15:15.831 --> 15:17.851
<b>Have mercy on me!</b>

15:17.851 --> 15:22.001
<b>Take me with you!
I can help you for sure!</b>

15:22.001 --> 15:24.501
<b><i>"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei.</i></b>

15:29.281 --> 15:30.721
<b>You need to give up on him!</b>

15:31.241 --> 15:34.411
<b>I mean, you need to trust Whitebeard.</b>

15:34.411 --> 15:38.891
<b>He's not gonna give up on one of his own!
He'll definitely do something!</b>

15:40.141 --> 15:41.401
<b>--I'm going!
--Huh?!</b>

15:43.361 --> 15:46.031
<b>I'm gonna go to the Navy Headquarters!</b>

15:48.071 --> 15:49.361
<b>Don't be stupid!</b>

15:51.571 --> 15:52.451
<b>What?</b>

15:53.031 --> 15:54.981
<b>If I give up now...</b>

15:56.161 --> 15:57.751
<b>...I'm gonna regret it!</b>

15:58.121 --> 16:03.191
<b>Straw Hat became the first intruder
in Impel Down's history...</b>

16:03.191 --> 16:07.301
<b>He snuck in alone
but when he came back out,</b>

16:07.301 --> 16:10.301
<b>he was surrounded by prisoners.</b>

16:11.091 --> 16:15.091
<b>He even allied with
those who he once fought...</b>

16:18.371 --> 16:24.461
<b>NAVY</b>

16:24.861 --> 16:29.691
<b>The terrible thing is whenever he 
does something, miracles happen...</b>

16:30.571 --> 16:34.701
<b>The prime example of that is
what happened at the Gates of Justice!</b>

16:39.331 --> 16:42.381
<b>Oh no-<i>gane</i>! We can't open it-<i>gane</i>!</b>

16:42.381 --> 16:45.881

16:48.551 --> 16:51.141
<b>--What're we gonna do, you shark?!
--Sail through it!</b>

17:01.891 --> 17:04.741
<b>Keep firing! Sink them...</b>

17:08.151 --> 17:11.001
<b>The Gates of Justice are opening!</b>

17:12.571 --> 17:13.611
<b>No way!</b>

17:14.071 --> 17:15.891
<b>Why are the Gates opening?!</b>

17:16.571 --> 17:19.411
<b>I was with him at the entrance a while ago!</b>

17:19.411 --> 17:22.251
<b>He stayed alone at Impel Down?!</b>

17:22.251 --> 17:24.791
<b><i>Hey, can you hear me, Bon-</i>chan<i>?!</i></b>

17:24.791 --> 17:27.541
<b><i>Why are you doing this?!</i></b>

17:27.541 --> 17:30.961
<b><i>We were gonna break out together,
weren't we?!</i></b>

17:31.671 --> 17:34.681
<b>How many times have I been saved by you?!</b>

17:35.261 --> 17:37.471
<b><i>If you are there, say something,

<b>Thank you!</b>

18:11.631 --> 18:14.761
<b><i>Brother Bon, thank you!</i></b>

18:14.761 --> 18:18.471
<b><i>--Thank you!

19:27.211 --> 19:29.311
<b>Portgas D. Ace...</b>

19:29.311 --> 19:34.131
