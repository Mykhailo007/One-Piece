<b>Be patient and wait!</b>

18:33.671 --> 18:38.961
<b>It'll come naturally. Your turn, I mean...</b>

18:40.411 --> 18:43.211
<b>Goodbye, Pedro.</b>

18:44.881 --> 18:47.531
<b>Okay, Roger!</b>

18:57.851 --> 18:59.351
<b>Pedro!</b>

19:00.101 --> 19:01.331
<b>Roger...</b>

19:01.641 --> 19:03.251
<b>What about him?</b>

19:07.111 --> 19:08.551
<b>They say he died!</b>

19:10.281 --> 19:11.621
<b>You've got to be kidding!</b>

19:11.621 --> 19:15.261
<b>He's not gonna die!
He's the King of the Pirates!</b>

19:16.121 --> 19:17.761
<b>I'm not kidding!</b>

19:17.761 --> 19:22.001
<b>He got caught by the Navy
and at an execution ground in the East Blue...</b>

19:44.231 --> 19:46.391
<b>My treasure?</b>

19:46.831 --> 19:49.301
<b>If you want it, you can have it!</b>

19:49.531 --> 19:51.211
<b>Find it!</b>

19:51.211 --> 19:54.431
<b>I left everything this 
world has to offer there!</b>

20:06.331 --> 20:12.391
<b>This is the beginning.
A new era has finally dawned.</b>

20:31.191 --> 20:36.251
<b><i>Wishes will be carried over.
The tide of time, people's dreams...</i></b>

20:36.251 --> 20:39.711
<b><i>Those things can't be stopped.</i></b>

20:41.071 --> 20:44.181
<b><i>As long as people search for
the meaning of freedom,</i></b>

20:44.181 --> 20:47.901
<b><i>those things will see no end.</i></b>

20:54.131 --> 20:55.571
<b>Roger...</b>

20:59.511 --> 21:00.781
<b>I decided.</b>

21:05.271 --> 21:08.121
<b>I'll take... to sea, too!</b>

21:11.251 --> 21:16.711
<b>Even if you deny it,
the dawn didn't come to you...</b>

21:16.711 --> 21:17.971
<b>Lick.</b>

21:18.321 --> 21:20.351
<b>You think... so?</b>

21:21.781 --> 21:26.851
<b>Roger said, "Everyone has their own turn"!</b>

21:27.161 --> 21:28.851
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

21:28.851 --> 21:30.691
<b>This is my turn!</b>

21:33.631 --> 21:37.151
<b>This will break all of your-<i>gara 
\</i>Nmagic spells, right?</b>

21:37.931 --> 21:39.061
<b>Bombs?!</b>

21:39.061 --> 21:42.851
<b>Stop, you fool!
What are you thinking?!</b>

21:43.351 --> 21:45.041
<b>Let go of me!</b>

21:49.731 --> 21:51.021
<b>I...</b>

21:52.191 --> 21:55.171
<b>...had a feeling that this 
would be my last journey.</b>

21:55.171 --> 21:57.281
<b>What do you mean, Pedro?</b>

22:03.591 --> 22:04.761
<b>Pedro?!</b>

22:05.371 --> 22:06.601
<b>Goodbye.</b>

22:36.191 --> 22:38.221
<b>What do you mean, Pedro?</b>

22:38.691 --> 22:42.141
<b>One day, you'll see how important it was...</b>

22:42.661 --> 22:47.451
<b>...to save Luffy and the others here
and let them set sail!</b>

22:51.461 --> 22:54.151
<b>Pedro!!</b>

22:55.341 --> 22:56.891
<b><i>Listen!</i></b>

22:56.891 --> 22:59.991
<b><i><i>You-</i>gara<i> guys must go forward!</i></i></b>

23:09.271 --> 23:12.421
<b><i><i>Pedro cleared the path for 
a slight chance of escape!</i></i></b>

23:12.871 --> 23:15.131
<b><i><i>However, to crush that ray of hope,</i></i></b>

23:15.131 --> 23:18.711
<b><i>Big Mom and Katakuri 
mercilessly attack the Sunny!</i></b>

23:18.871 --> 23:21.001
<b><i><i>There is only one way to survive!</i></i></b>

23:21.001 --> 23:25.801
<b><i>With Pedro's wishes in mind,
Luffy takes a big bet with determination!</i></b>

23:25.801 --> 23:30.631
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"I'll Be Back! Luffy, Deadly Departure!"</b>

23:30.631 --> 23:33.101
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
