<b>Nice to see you again, Zeus.</b>

16:24.861 --> 16:27.141
<b>Nice... to... see you... too...</b>

16:30.381 --> 16:33.621
<b>As I recall, you tried to...</b>

16:34.371 --> 16:37.811
<b>...strike me with lightning earlier.</b>

16:38.841 --> 16:39.651
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

16:39.651 --> 16:44.401
<b>If "sorry" were enough,
there would be no need for sheriffs or the Navy.</b>

16:48.341 --> 16:51.311
<b>I bet you got it wrong...</b>

16:51.641 --> 16:57.421
<b>I didn't mean to become your friend
from the start.</b>

16:57.421 --> 16:58.381
<b>What?</b>

16:58.381 --> 17:00.041
<b>Let me ask you again.</b>

17:01.211 --> 17:04.881
<b>Do you wanna be my servant or...</b>

17:06.341 --> 17:07.381
<b>...do you wanna die?</b>

17:08.821 --> 17:12.031
<b>Think about it carefully.</b>

17:15.251 --> 17:18.461
<b>Mama! Mama!</b>

17:21.151 --> 17:22.731
<b>Shut up...</b>

17:22.921 --> 17:24.071
<b>Mama!</b>

17:26.631 --> 17:29.071
<b>Chase them, Prometheus!</b>

17:29.071 --> 17:30.591
<b>Yes, Mama!</b>

17:34.641 --> 17:40.271
<b><i>Every attack has an intent.
Don't attack blindly, Luffy.</i></b>

17:53.201 --> 17:54.851
<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

17:55.971 --> 17:58.981
<b>...Twin Jet Pistol!</b>

18:03.711 --> 18:05.011
<b>All right!</b>

18:05.711 --> 18:07.441
<b>How's that, Rayleigh?</b>

18:07.921 --> 18:13.121
<b>Don't get carried away.
You've only accomplished the first step.</b>

18:13.751 --> 18:14.831
<b>Next,</b>

18:15.471 --> 18:17.791
<b>I'll be your opponent.</b>

18:18.681 --> 18:20.421
<b>Ouch!</b>

18:20.731 --> 18:25.521
<b>You have no time to rest!
If you can't dodge 100 times, you're not allowed to eat.</b>

18:25.521 --> 18:26.301
<b>What?!</b>

18:26.741 --> 18:28.881
<b>Sounds terrible? Then, focus!</b>

18:35.841 --> 18:37.161
<b>There you are!</b>

18:37.571 --> 18:39.411
<b>Ouch!</b>

18:39.621 --> 18:43.131
<b>Your opponent doesn't always 
come from the front.</b>

18:44.121 --> 18:48.531
<b>It's easy to read animals' minds
since they show all of their emotions.</b>

18:48.921 --> 18:55.781
<b>But humans are different...
We can defy expectations and cheat others.</b>

18:56.931 --> 18:58.581
<b>GROWWWL</b>

18:58.891 --> 19:00.501
<b>Ouch!</b>

19:11.451 --> 19:14.471
<b>I'm hungry, Rayleigh!</b>

19:14.471 --> 19:18.811
<b>Will your enemy stop attacking you
because you're hungry?</b>

19:20.901 --> 19:22.751
<b>Every attack has an intent.</b>

19:22.921 --> 19:23.671
<b>Ow!</b>

19:23.831 --> 19:25.651
<b>And a hint.</b>

19:30.421 --> 19:32.201
<b>I smell something delicious.</b>

19:32.841 --> 19:35.951
<b>That's my dinner. Don't pay it any mind.</b>

19:41.481 --> 19:42.831
<b>There you are!</b>

19:48.411 --> 19:49.481
<b>There!</b>

19:56.661 --> 20:00.491
<b>Don't attack blindly, Luffy!</b>

20:02.541 --> 20:06.271
<b>Rayleigh, that hurts!
I feel your anger!</b>

20:06.651 --> 20:08.231
<b>That's Haki, too!</b>

20:08.251 --> 20:10.301
<b>Sharpen your senses!</b>

20:10.461 --> 20:11.801
<b>Ouch!</b>

20:11.961 --> 20:14.381
<b>Feel your enemy's presence!</b>

20:14.551 --> 20:16.911
<b>I feel your anger!</b>

20:19.811 --> 20:23.181
<b>Every attack has an intent.</b>

20:24.981 --> 20:26.511
<b>And a hint.</b>

20:29.981 --> 20:32.971
<b>What is that fool doing?</b>

20:37.491 --> 20:40.011
<b>Sharpen your senses.</b>

21:01.851 --> 21:04.851

21:10.231 --> 21:11.691
<b>Don't...</b>

21:12.321 --> 21:14.971

21:14.971 --> 21:17.681
<b>Fall into despair, Straw Hat.</b>

21:22.871 --> 21:24.181
<b><i>Did he just...</i></b>

21:43.761 --> 21:45.451
<b>Every attack...</b>

21:46.311 --> 21:47.581
<b>...has an intent!</b>

21:56.281 --> 21:57.261
<b><i>No way!</i></b>

22:08.161 --> 22:09.701
<b>Every attack...</b>

22:10.461 --> 22:12.121

22:16.461 --> 22:17.531

22:42.621 --> 22:44.891

<b><i>The fateful moment approaches!</i></b>

23:25.331 --> 23:26.931
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!</b>

23:26.931 --> 23:30.351
