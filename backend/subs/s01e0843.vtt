This is the beginning of the real escape!</b>

14:47.291 --> 14:50.331
<b>Form two military units, Daifuku.</b>

14:50.331 --> 14:51.541
<b>Okay.</b>

14:52.371 --> 14:55.841
<b>We'll split up into two groups
and chase them!</b>

14:55.841 --> 15:01.631
<b>One group, bring back Straw Hat's head!
And the other, bring back Bege's!</b>

15:07.771 --> 15:08.851
<b>Mama.</b>

15:12.021 --> 15:15.271
<b>Don't worry.
We won't let anyone escape...</b>

15:15.631 --> 15:17.361
<b>Cake...</b>

15:19.611 --> 15:23.111
<b>Its ingredients were carefully selected...</b>

15:23.541 --> 15:26.711
<b>It was going to be the 
best wedding cake ever...</b>

15:27.451 --> 15:32.081
<b>I was looking forward to it...</b>

15:38.421 --> 15:42.681
<b>Wedding cake...</b>

15:44.321 --> 15:45.341
<b>Mama?</b>

15:50.021 --> 15:55.811
<b>Where's my wedding cake?!</b>

15:56.981 --> 15:58.571
<b>Not now...</b>

15:58.571 --> 16:01.281
<b>Bring it to me now!</b>

16:01.821 --> 16:06.951
<b>Wedding cake!</b>

16:26.221 --> 16:32.811
<b>My wedding cake!</b>

16:32.811 --> 16:35.231
<b>Where is it?!</b>

16:36.771 --> 16:38.111
<b>Run!</b>

16:42.321 --> 16:44.241
<b>We're in trouble-<i>fa</i>!</b>

16:44.521 --> 16:46.611
<b>My...</b>

16:48.121 --> 16:49.371
<b>Big Bro Opera!</b>

16:49.371 --> 16:52.671
<b>Smoothie! We gotta run-<i>fa</i>!</b>

16:52.671 --> 16:53.581
<b>Wait!</b>

16:53.831 --> 16:57.051
<b>You're responsible for all this!</b>

16:57.791 --> 17:01.381
<b>Why did you lie and say 
you killed Straw Hat?!</b>

17:01.381 --> 17:04.841
<b>It's inexcusable to deceive your family!</b>

17:05.801 --> 17:10.261
<b>Even if you run now,
you have nowhere to go!</b>

17:11.011 --> 17:12.721
<b>Take responsibility for it!</b>

17:17.231 --> 17:20.151
<b>You'd better run-<i>fa</i>!</b>

17:21.771 --> 17:24.651
<b>Wedding cake!</b>

17:27.281 --> 17:28.361
<b>Mama!</b>

17:30.411 --> 17:33.911
<b>What? Are you...</b>

17:34.341 --> 17:37.621
<b>...trying to get in my way?!</b>

17:43.821 --> 17:47.821
<b>GERMA KINGDOM</b>

17:48.091 --> 17:51.221
<b>I can't reach Judge-<i>sama</i> or Ichiji-<i>sama</i>!</b>

17:51.221 --> 17:53.361
<b>What happened?</b>

17:54.851 --> 17:55.721
<b>What's that?!</b>

18:04.401 --> 18:06.491
<b>The Big Mom Pirates?!</b>

18:06.491 --> 18:10.911
<b>We'll take over the Germa Kingdom!</b>

18:14.331 --> 18:17.961
<b>Okay, we'll pick up the Shark Submerge</b>

18:18.411 --> 18:21.001
<b>and go straight to the Sunny!</b>

18:21.001 --> 18:23.461
<b>Yeah. Be careful!</b>

18:23.461 --> 18:26.841
<b>We gotta hurry up, too,
and get back to the coast where we landed!</b>

18:26.841 --> 18:30.011
<b>Uh-huh! Let's get out of the territory
before they come for us!</b>

18:30.011 --> 18:33.721
<b>--Hey! I'm leaving, okay?!
--Okay, let's hurry up!</b>

18:33.721 --> 18:35.311
<b>--Straw Hat!
--Let's go!</b>

18:35.311 --> 18:39.291
<b>Hey! Straw Hat! Straw Hat!</b>

18:39.291 --> 18:42.271
<b>Straw Hat!</b>

18:50.781 --> 18:54.601
<b>I'm going to do this, 
that and the other thing!</b>

18:54.601 --> 18:59.541
<b>I'm gonna enjoy my freedom to the fullest!</b>

19:01.621 --> 19:03.461
<b>Goodbye!</b>

19:03.461 --> 19:05.751
<b>What?! Wait a minute!</b>

19:06.261 --> 19:10.061
<b>The Tea Party turned out to be
like that-<i>chocolat</i>?!</b>

19:10.061 --> 19:12.581
<b>Th-The Straw Hats?!</b>

19:12.581 --> 19:17.371
<b>Yeah, it was a disaster!
The wedding and the wedding cake were all ruined!</b>

19:17.371 --> 19:19.641
<b>The execution of the Vinsmokes was foiled!</b>

19:20.161 --> 19:24.651
<b>On top of all that, Bege was betraying us
and plotting to kill Mama!</b>

19:24.651 --> 19:30.441
<b>Damn Bege... I completely respected 
him for his great abilities-<i>noir</i>!</b>

19:30.441 --> 19:35.121
<b>But we still don't know anything
about the explosion.</b>

19:31.011 --> 19:35.011
<b>COMPOTE - ELDEST DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE</b>

19:37.581 --> 19:42.851
<b>Those fools were on the rooftops, too,
so if they did it, they must've been suicidal.</b>

19:42.851 --> 19:44.421
<b>It's not very likely.</b>

19:44.421 --> 19:48.821
<b>But one mystery has been solved-<i>mour</i>.</b>

19:48.821 --> 19:50.641
<b><i>The thing is during the Tea Party,</i></b>

19:50.641 --> 19:54.931
<b><i>all lines of communication 
to the venue were jammed-<i>bon</i>!</i></b>

19:54.931 --> 19:58.061
<b>It was probably Bege and his allies.</b>

19:58.061 --> 20:01.191
<b>Was there anything that you wanted to report?</b>

20:01.191 --> 20:07.191
<b>Well, during the Tea Party, the Sun Pirates
who were staying on the east coast...</b>

20:07.191 --> 20:10.991
<b>That's right! They fled! Grr!</b>

20:10.991 --> 20:12.161
<b>Pekoms?!</b>

20:12.161 --> 20:17.071
<b>All members of the Fish-Man Pirates
packed up and fled!</b>

20:17.071 --> 20:21.121
<b>I see... That's why Jimbei did <i>that</i>.</b>

20:23.131 --> 20:24.041
<b>Jimbei...</b>

20:25.041 --> 20:29.811
<b>...quit the Big Mom Pirates
and joined the Straw Hats.</b>

20:30.711 --> 20:34.131
<b>What?! Jimbei quit?!</b>

20:34.131 --> 20:37.181
<b>Yeah...
And now I know the reason for his action.</b>

20:38.891 --> 20:41.201
<b>He knew Mama'd take out her anger
on his friends.</b>

20:41.201 --> 20:44.141
<b>So to tell his friends about 
that and give them time to flee,</b>

20:44.141 --> 20:46.981
<b>Jimbei once reneged on his request to quit.</b>

20:47.501 --> 20:50.861
<b>It's a clever strategy and very Jimbei.</b>

20:50.861 --> 20:52.071
<b>Katakuri!</b>

20:52.751 --> 20:56.191
<b>Our troops are already chasing
Straw Hat and Bege!</b>

20:57.041 --> 20:58.161
<b>Got it.</b>

20:58.161 --> 21:01.581
<b>And a detached force is 
already invading Germa.</b>

21:01.581 --> 21:05.001
<b>Okay... Brulee, come with me!</b>

21:05.001 --> 21:10.591
<b>Of course, I will, my brother!
Can you take out Straw Hat and the others?</b>

21:10.931 --> 21:12.421
<b>I wanna make them pay!</b>

21:12.841 --> 21:16.551
<b>They drove me like a horse</b>

21:16.551 --> 21:19.801
<b>and made me help them try to kill Mama!</b>

21:20.551 --> 21:22.141
<b>I'm planning to do so...</b>

21:22.721 --> 21:25.231
<b>I'm gonna cut off Straw Hat's head!</b>

21:26.021 --> 21:30.881
<b>I realized it's necessary to get rid of him
before he really becomes...</b>

21:30.881 --> 21:33.651
<b>...a threat to Mama down the line.</b>

21:50.751 --> 21:53.341
<b>Everyone! Get out of the city!</b>

21:53.341 --> 21:54.671
<b>Smoothie!</b>

21:55.301 --> 21:57.271
<b>Run as far as you can!</b>

22:01.351 --> 22:02.681
<b>At a time like this?!</b>

22:02.681 --> 22:05.271
<b>What's the matter, Smoothie?!</b>

22:06.231 --> 22:08.891
<b>Everybody! Run!</b>

22:17.721 --> 22:21.241
<b>Don't tell me it's happening now!</b>

22:32.211 --> 22:35.921
<b>Wedding...</b>

22:35.921 --> 22:39.591
<b>...cake!</b>

22:39.591 --> 22:42.051
<b>It's her Hunger Pangs!</b>

22:52.651 --> 22:59.491
<b>Wedding cake!!</b>

23:09.711 --> 23:12.431
<b><i><i>Luffy and his clan run straight to the Sunny!</i></i></b>

23:12.431 --> 23:15.531
