<b>Good job, you guys! Let me have a go, too!</b>

16:33.871 --> 16:35.161
<b>Jimbei, wait!</b>

16:35.831 --> 16:39.961
<b>I'll go load cola so could you take my place?
Please!</b>

16:40.131 --> 16:40.841
<b>What?!</b>

16:41.001 --> 16:46.631
<b>Don't worry. We have a Tone Dial
with an audio recording of Franky for these occasions.</b>

16:47.761 --> 16:49.971
<b>Th-This?!</b>

16:50.851 --> 16:54.641
<b><i>Franky's navigation system, activate.</i></b>

16:55.311 --> 16:57.901
<b>O... Okay...</b>

16:59.901 --> 17:03.361
<b>Second round, prepare to fire!
Maintain your aim.</b>

17:06.151 --> 17:08.951
<b>Oh, good... Seems like it's not broken.</b>

17:09.371 --> 17:12.871
<b>It's just one of the barrels fell on the floor...</b>

17:13.041 --> 17:16.081
<b>All ships are prepared to fire for a second round!</b>

17:16.251 --> 17:17.211
<b>Fire!</b>

17:18.831 --> 17:19.921
<b>They fired again!</b>

17:20.081 --> 17:24.381
<b>Chopper-<i>san</i>, let's bring them down no matter what
until the cola energy is filled up!</b>

17:24.551 --> 17:25.471
<b>Yeah!</b>

17:29.471 --> 17:34.311
<b><i>When the barrel of cola is loaded,
push the lever forward!</i></b>

17:34.471 --> 17:35.641
<b>All right!</b>

17:40.611 --> 17:43.361
<b>It's starting to move! I gotta hurry!</b>

17:48.361 --> 17:53.241
<b>Where is it...? The wedding cake!</b>

17:53.411 --> 17:57.411
<b>What are you doing?!
Don't bite our Sunny!</b>

17:57.461 --> 18:00.461
<b>Damn! If it goes on like this...</b>

18:02.461 --> 18:03.791
<b>Idiot! Go away!</b>

18:05.301 --> 18:07.301
<b>Big Bro, I'm here to save you!</b>

18:08.301 --> 18:11.391
<b>Carrot! Hang on. Can you get up?</b>

18:11.551 --> 18:15.011
<b>Yes... Nami, thank you.</b>

18:17.811 --> 18:20.481
<b>Where is it?!</b>

18:20.651 --> 18:21.691
<b>Big Mom!</b>

18:21.851 --> 18:26.901
<b>We're really in trouble!
We have to get out of here before the ship is destroyed!</b>

18:33.911 --> 18:38.331
<b>Is that... Pedro?! Is he alive?!</b>

18:51.301 --> 18:54.641
<b>Damn! Pedro, that bastard!</b>

18:54.801 --> 18:57.391
<b>--That's not Pedro!
--No...</b>

18:57.561 --> 19:00.731
<b>Oh, man... I felt my blood freeze...</b>

19:00.771 --> 19:04.231
<b>My Candy Armor is destroyed completely...</b>

19:06.861 --> 19:11.321
<b>No way... Why is he-<i>teia</i> alive?!</b>

19:13.321 --> 19:16.451
<b>Seems like all the shots of the second round
were intercepted!</b>

19:16.621 --> 19:19.451
<b>Third round! Hurry up and load!</b>

19:21.001 --> 19:23.791
<b>L-Let go of me!</b>

19:23.961 --> 19:25.381
<b>Nami! Carrot!</b>

19:26.251 --> 19:27.591
<b>Jimbei!</b>

19:27.631 --> 19:29.011
<b>Brook!</b>

19:29.051 --> 19:30.461
<b>Chopper!</b>

19:47.151 --> 19:48.611
<b>Listen to me!</b>

19:49.231 --> 19:52.781
<b>I'll be back! I'll leave the rest to you!</b>

19:52.951 --> 19:55.321
<b>What?! What do you mean by that?!</b>

20:00.911 --> 20:05.501
<b><i>When the lever returns to its original position,
the filling is complete!</i></b>

20:05.671 --> 20:08.381
<b>All right, everyone! Hang onto something!</b>

20:08.541 --> 20:09.671
<b>I got it!</b>

20:09.841 --> 20:12.131
<b>We're ready anytime!</b>

20:12.301 --> 20:13.671
<b>We're ready, too!</b>

20:15.721 --> 20:17.141
<b>Okay, here we go!</b>

20:18.641 --> 20:21.311
<b>Don't let them get away! Fire!</b>

20:24.851 --> 20:25.641
<b>Now!</b>

20:25.811 --> 20:29.271
<b><i>Everybody! Don't forget to shout it!</i></b>

20:29.441 --> 20:32.691
<b>Coup de...</b>

20:34.951 --> 20:37.871
<b>...Burst!</b>

20:41.291 --> 20:44.461
<b><i>Super!</i></b>

20:50.671 --> 20:53.381
<b><i>Guys! Did it go well?!</i></b>

20:53.421 --> 20:57.221
<b><i>Fly away at max speed!</i></b>

20:57.391 --> 20:58.391
<b>Okay!</b>

21:07.231 --> 21:08.771
<b>This is Amande.</b>

21:08.811 --> 21:11.861
<b>The enemy ship fled
to the sky.</b>

21:12.021 --> 21:13.151
<b><i>The sky?!</i></b>

21:17.111 --> 21:19.121
<b>Hey, where's Luffy?!</b>

21:24.041 --> 21:26.541
<b>--That's Straw Hat!
--Run!</b>

21:32.841 --> 21:38.051
<b>MIRROWORLD</b>

21:47.941 --> 21:49.601
<b>You succeeded...</b>

21:50.441 --> 21:53.071
<b>Here, I can pummel you as much as I want!</b>

21:56.531 --> 21:59.951
<b>--The path to the ship!
--He cut it off himself!</b>

22:17.721 --> 22:21.551
<b>So that's a captain's determination...</b>

22:22.551 --> 22:25.681
<b>But you're no match for me.</b>

22:25.721 --> 22:28.391
<b>This place will be your graveyard.</b>

22:28.771 --> 22:31.231
<b>I'll go back to the Sunny!</b>

22:31.271 --> 22:33.361
<b>After I take you down!</b>

23:09.311 --> 23:14.401
<b><i>Unbelievable power and speed, as well as
Haki of the Color of Observation that allows him to see the future!</i></b>

23:14.441 --> 23:19.901
<b><i>The Big Mom's Pirates' most formidable agent,
Katakuri's extraordinary fighting strength!</i></b>
