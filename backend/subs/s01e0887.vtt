13:08.951 --> 13:14.171
<b>You know, Shirahoshi, what you did
is what we would call pretty stupid in this world!</b>

13:14.371 --> 13:18.041
<b>Father-<i>sama</i>! Brothers-<i>sama</i>!</b>

13:18.881 --> 13:23.421
<b><i>At the Fish-Man Island, they rescued 
Shirahoshi and the others who were captured,</i></b>

13:23.421 --> 13:26.801
<b><i>and stopped the coup by 
the New Fish-Man Pirates.</i></b>

13:27.091 --> 13:29.601
<b><i>They saved the Ryugu Kingdom from the crisis.</i></b>

13:34.771 --> 13:36.981
<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

13:37.151 --> 13:42.071
<b>...Elephant Gatling!</b>

13:52.851 --> 13:53.641
<b><i>In addition...</i></b>

13:54.411 --> 13:55.461
<b>The sweets are gone!</b>

13:56.251 --> 13:57.581
<b>I ate them all!</b>

13:57.751 --> 13:59.631
<b>I ate 10 tons of them!</b>

13:59.921 --> 14:02.171
<b><i>Monkey D. Luffy...</i></b>

14:02.171 --> 14:04.101
<b><i>I know your name now.</i></b>

14:04.471 --> 14:07.721
<b><i>Come! To the New World!</i></b>

14:09.051 --> 14:10.901
<b>Sure, wait for me there.</b>

14:11.661 --> 14:14.021
<b>There's some business I want 
to settle with you, too.</b>

14:16.891 --> 14:20.611
<b>I can't leave <i>it</i> in your hands -
that's too dangerous!</b>

14:21.021 --> 14:24.611
<b>I'll kick your ass all over the New World...</b>

14:25.651 --> 14:28.661
<b>...and make the Fish-Man Island my territory!</b>

14:33.661 --> 14:37.831
<b>I can't believe he picked a fight with
one of the Four Emperors at the Fish-Man Island.</b>

14:39.631 --> 14:40.841
<b>That's funny!</b>

14:42.591 --> 14:45.201
<b><i>The Straw Hats entered the New World</i></b>

14:45.631 --> 14:50.751
<b><i>and arrived at Punk Hazard,
the mysterious island where fire and snow coexist.</i></b>

14:51.851 --> 14:52.721
<b>All right!</b>

14:53.261 --> 14:55.221
<b>Let's go, recon team!</b>

14:55.891 --> 14:58.351
<b><i>While Luffy was exploring the island,</i></b>

14:58.941 --> 15:01.711
<b><i>he met Trafalgar Law again.</i></b>

15:02.441 --> 15:05.821
<b>There are only two ways to survive
in the New World.</b>

15:06.651 --> 15:11.871
<b>Either by living under the Four Emperors
or going against them.</b>

15:12.991 --> 15:17.371
<b>And I guess you're not the kind of person
who wants to work under someone.</b>

15:18.001 --> 15:20.961
<b>Yeah, I want to stay as a captain.</b>

15:21.211 --> 15:25.841
<b>Then, we have to form an alliance!</b>

15:25.841 --> 15:27.011
<b>An alliance?</b>

15:27.381 --> 15:30.891
<b>If you and I join forces, maybe we can do it.</b>

15:33.641 --> 15:35.311
<b>I have a plan...</b>

15:36.221 --> 15:38.421
<b>...to bring down one of the Four Emperors!</b>

15:38.941 --> 15:41.561
<b>Which of the Four Emperors 
are you talking about?</b>

15:42.941 --> 15:44.821
<b>The Emperor's name is...</b>

15:45.531 --> 15:48.151
<b>...Kaido, the King of the Beasts!</b>

15:49.821 --> 15:53.031
<b>As long as Shanks is not the first one to fight,
I have no problem.</b>

15:54.621 --> 15:55.681
<b>Because...</b>

15:56.331 --> 16:00.081
<b>...I plan to beat all of the Four Emperors!</b>

16:00.251 --> 16:02.631
<b>"Beat all of the Four Emperors"?</b>

16:02.671 --> 16:05.591
<b>We share a mutual interest
but you're underestimating them.</b>

16:06.521 --> 16:10.211
<b>They are the emperors of the sea who have
skirmished over territories</b>

16:10.211 --> 16:12.001
<b>even against Whitebeard himself.</b>

16:12.431 --> 16:18.331
<b>And above all, they say Kaido, the King of the Beasts
is the strongest creature in the world.</b>

16:18.811 --> 16:22.901
<b>We'll ally with each other 
until we kill Kaido.</b>

16:22.901 --> 16:25.361
<b>And our chances of success are...</b>

16:25.821 --> 16:28.531
<b>Well, I'll just say they're really low.</b>

16:28.691 --> 16:30.451
<b>Okay, let's do it!</b>

16:31.071 --> 16:35.871
<b><i>Thus, the Straw Hats and the 
Heart Pirates led by Law...</i></b>

16:35.871 --> 16:39.831
<b><i>...formed the pirate alliance
to take down one of the Four Emperors - Kaido.</i></b>

16:41.461 --> 16:45.591
<b><i>And, with Kin'emon, the samurai 
from the Land of Wano,</i></b>

16:45.591 --> 16:48.091
<b><i>they saved the captured Momonosuke...</i></b>

16:48.321 --> 16:51.811
<b>...<i>who was a son of Kozuki Oden,
the great </i>daimyo<i> of the Land of Wano.</i></b>

16:52.841 --> 16:56.391
<b><i><i>Then they took down Caesar Clown,
the mad scientist and the</i></i></b>

16:56.391 --> 16:58.361
<b><i>former colleague of Dr. Vegapunk,</i></b>

16:58.361 --> 17:01.531
<b><i>and released the children
who were being treated as guinea pigs.</i></b>

<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

17:07.021 --> 17:10.741
<b>...Grizzly Magnum!</b>

17:20.241 --> 17:26.711
<b><i>Next, they infiltrated Dressrosa
where the Warlord - Doflamingo reigned.</i></b>

17:29.211 --> 17:31.671
<b>We made it! Dressrosa!</b>

17:32.471 --> 17:38.851
<b><i>After learning that the country was
unjustly governed by Doflamingo's plot,</i></b>

17:40.261 --> 17:43.231
<b><i>Luffy clashed with Doflamingo who used
the Haki of the Color of the Supreme King</i></b>

17:43.851 --> 17:47.481
<b><i>and activated his new technique - Gear Four.</i></b>

17:48.151 --> 17:50.981
<b>Do your worst, brat!</b>

17:51.731 --> 17:53.241
<b>Spiderweb!</b>

17:57.071 --> 17:59.081
<b>King Kong...</b>

17:59.701 --> 18:02.701
<b>Sixteen Holy Bullets!</b>

18:04.161 --> 18:05.711
<b>God Thread!</b>

18:05.711 --> 18:07.251
<b>...Gun!</b>

18:23.221 --> 18:25.891
<b><i>By heroically taking down Doflamingo,</i></b>

18:26.731 --> 18:30.861
<b><i>Luffy freed the citizens who were suffering 
from the tyranny, and the former king.</i></b>

18:31.651 --> 18:36.201
<b><i>The news and the video that were broadcasted
to the neighboring countries spread instantly</i></b>

18:36.201 --> 18:38.431
<b><i>and shook up the world.</i></b>

18:39.411 --> 18:44.871
<b>Freedom... Freedom...
That's what Luffy-<i>senpai</i> wants...</b>

18:44.871 --> 18:50.641
<b>In that case, I admire you 
even more, Luffy-<i>senpai</i>!</b>

18:54.921 --> 18:57.291
<b><i><i>In addition, the tough ones who Luffy</i></i></b>

18:57.291 --> 19:00.571
<b><i>met in Dressrosa and fought alongside 
to bring down Doflamingo...</i></b>

19:00.571 --> 19:05.261
<b><i><i>...rallied around Luffy, and 
the Straw Hat Fleet with over</i></i></b>

19:05.261 --> 19:08.151
<b><i>5,600 troops total was formed.</i></b>

19:10.521 --> 19:16.031
<b><i>Then, Luffy and the others arrived at
the traveling country Zou</i></b>

19:16.031 --> 19:20.261
<b><i>and learned that the Land of Wano had been
suppressed by Kaido and its shogun...</i></b>

19:22.201 --> 19:23.451
<b>Let's join hands!</b>

19:26.041 --> 19:27.161
<b>We're allies!</b>

19:28.661 --> 19:31.821
<b>Let me have Kaido's head though!</b>

19:35.921 --> 19:40.971
<b>Thank you! Thank you!</b>

19:41.471 --> 19:43.261
<b>Our objective is...</b>

19:48.181 --> 19:52.071
<b>...to kick Emperor Kaido's butt!</b>

19:55.691 --> 20:02.991
<b>We're the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance!</b>

20:04.581 --> 20:09.291
<b><i>However, to take back Sanji
who was involved in a political marriage,</i></b>

20:09.291 --> 20:11.701
<b><i>the crew temporarily split up</i></b>

20:12.541 --> 20:16.861
<b><i>and Luffy infiltrated the Whole Cake Island
ruled by the Emperor of the Sea - Big Mom.</i></b>

20:18.171 --> 20:22.051
<b><i>At last, Luffy and the others 
clashed with Big Mom!</i></b>

20:22.801 --> 20:26.261
<b><i>The furious Big Mom Pirates came after them,</i></b>

20:26.261 --> 20:31.181

<b><i>The news about Luffy and the others

21:30.241 --> 21:31.201

21:36.331 --> 21:41.461
<b>What a pain in the neck!

<b>...jumped to 1.5 billion berries

<b>It's the time of the Reverie now...</b>

22:22.331 --> 22:26.511
<b>Considering your status, you
