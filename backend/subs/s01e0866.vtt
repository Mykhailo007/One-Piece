<b>I'm impressed that they survived!
They don't even have their captain to lead them!</b>

16:08.161 --> 16:10.781
<b>Nami-<i>san</i>!</b>

16:10.781 --> 16:14.511
<b>There's someone on the bow!
Don't you feel that strange energy?</b>

16:14.831 --> 16:19.211
<b>That's not Haki...
Why are they coming on Bege's ship?</b>

16:19.961 --> 16:23.101
<b>Hm? Someone's dancing on the bow!</b>

16:23.101 --> 16:27.051
<b>Forget about it.
What really matters is the cake!</b>

16:27.051 --> 16:28.741
<b>Lick!</b>

16:28.741 --> 16:35.261
<b>They surely recreated the wedding cake
that we saw at the wedding!</b>

16:36.851 --> 16:42.571
<b>If Mama likes the flavor,
her Hunger Pangs attack will stop! But...</b>

16:42.571 --> 16:47.281
<b>...there's Bege!
I'm sure that the cake is poisoned!</b>

16:47.281 --> 16:51.801
<b>What should I do?! What should I do?!
What should I do?! What should I do?!</b>

16:55.511 --> 17:00.191
<b>Thanks to the sweet smell,
she's broken off her onslaught...</b>

17:00.191 --> 17:01.571
<b>I thought...</b>

17:01.571 --> 17:04.561
<b>...I was gonna die...</b>

17:05.761 --> 17:08.491
<b><i><i>Should we destroy the cake?!</i></i></b>

17:08.491 --> 17:13.141
<b><i><i>Well, if we do that, there'll be 
no stopping Mama's attacks and</i></i></b>

17:13.141 --> 17:14.571
<b><i>the country will be ruined!</i></b>

17:15.021 --> 17:19.061
<b><i><i>Oh, but if she dies eating the poisoned cake,
both the country</i></i></b>

17:19.061 --> 17:22.071
<b><i>and the pirate group are doomed!</i></b>

17:22.071 --> 17:26.001
<b><i>What should I do?!
Which should I choose?!</i></b>

17:27.451 --> 17:29.121
<b>Hey, Black-Leg!</b>

17:30.451 --> 17:35.641
<b>You got yourself a deal!
We'll have this cake.</b>

17:36.541 --> 17:42.691
<b>As you wish, we won't do anything
until Mama eats it and gets filled up...</b>

17:43.001 --> 17:44.471
<b>But...</b>

17:45.131 --> 17:47.981
<b>...I'm free to do anything after that, right?</b>

17:50.761 --> 17:56.821
<b>Do as you like. Our mission was to
calm Big Mom down with the cake.</b>

17:57.271 --> 17:59.231
<b>We can stop her!</b>

17:59.231 --> 18:01.701
<b>We're ready, Sanji!</b>

18:02.611 --> 18:03.691
<b>...<i>San</i>!</b>

18:03.691 --> 18:04.871
<b>Coming.</b>

18:04.871 --> 18:07.831
<b>Hurry up, you fool, if you don't wanna die!</b>

18:08.451 --> 18:09.621
<b>Pudding!</b>

18:11.371 --> 18:13.291
<b>Take care of yourself!</b>

18:16.331 --> 18:18.511
<b>Are you happy now?</b>

18:19.371 --> 18:20.541
<b>Yes, very...</b>

18:21.461 --> 18:23.501
<b>When you have someone who 
loves you like you love them,</b>

18:23.501 --> 18:25.261
<b>the world will never be the same.</b>

18:26.131 --> 18:29.521
<b>Don't let your happiness go.</b>

18:29.521 --> 18:31.781
<b>Yeah, don't you either.</b>

18:32.261 --> 18:33.581
<b>Me?</b>

18:41.981 --> 18:44.491
<b>Goodbye, Big Sis...</b>

18:47.991 --> 18:50.331
<b>Rabian! Super fast!</b>

18:53.031 --> 18:56.541
<b>Go fast so Big Bro Peros
and Big Bro Bavarois won't notice!</b>

18:56.541 --> 18:57.381
<b>Okay!</b>

19:03.041 --> 19:07.461
<b>My wedding cake!</b>

19:07.461 --> 19:09.271
<b>There it is!</b>

19:11.801 --> 19:14.851
<b>I finally found it! Let's go!</b>

19:14.851 --> 19:15.971
<b>Yes!</b>

19:15.971 --> 19:17.301
<b>Mama!</b>

19:17.301 --> 19:22.231
<b>Wedding cake!</b>

19:22.231 --> 19:25.771
<b>--There she comes! Starboard!
--Yes, sir!</b>

19:25.771 --> 19:30.691
<b>Go southwest at full speed!
We'll head toward Liqueur Island!</b>

19:34.031 --> 19:35.491
<b>Lick?</b>

19:35.491 --> 19:40.001
<b>Perospero-<i>sama</i>!
The ship with the cake changed its course!</b>

19:40.001 --> 19:41.081
<b>Why?!</b>

19:41.081 --> 19:45.381
<b>Mama is being lured by the cake
and started chasing Bege's ship!</b>

19:45.381 --> 19:48.401
<b>Straw Hat's ship and Bege's ship...</b>

19:48.401 --> 19:53.111
<b>By splitting up,
they're trying to divide us...</b>

19:53.111 --> 19:54.681
<b>Lick!</b>

19:57.471 --> 19:59.561
<b>Hey! I'm back!</b>

19:59.561 --> 20:02.641
<b>--Sanji-<i>kun</i>!
--Sanji-<i>san</i>! Pudding-<i>san</i>!</b>

20:02.641 --> 20:04.151
<b>Sanji!</b>

20:04.151 --> 20:07.691
<b>We were hanging by a hair!
I thought we were done for! Thank you!</b>

20:07.691 --> 20:10.151
<b>I'm glad that you're okay!</b>

20:14.411 --> 20:16.331
<b>Thump!</b>

20:16.701 --> 20:19.551
<b>I love you, too! Nami-<i>san</i>!</b>

20:20.581 --> 20:24.381
<b>By the way, Sanji-<i>san</i>,
why were you on Bege's ship?</b>

20:26.381 --> 20:28.261
<b>It's a long story...</b>

20:28.261 --> 20:31.311
<b>Where is his ship headed?</b>

20:32.011 --> 20:35.711
<b>We don't know what Mom will do
after she eats the cake...</b>

20:36.471 --> 20:40.761
<b>So they're taking the cake 
to the nearest island.</b>

20:40.761 --> 20:44.481
<b>What? So they took it upon 
themselves to be bait?!</b>

20:44.481 --> 20:46.761
<b>Why is he doing that?!</b>

20:46.761 --> 20:49.661
<b>He hasn't given up on killing her.</b>

20:49.661 --> 20:52.081
<b>I see. That sounds like Bege.</b>

20:52.861 --> 20:55.931
<b>This ship's safety is the only thing
that matters to me.</b>

20:55.931 --> 20:59.421
<b>If he lures Mom, I can't ask for more...</b>

20:59.911 --> 21:00.631
<b>Anyway...</b>

21:02.701 --> 21:04.631
<b>It's taken a lot of damage...</b>

21:04.631 --> 21:07.211
<b>I'm sorry. I should've done better...</b>

21:07.211 --> 21:11.921
<b>What are you talking about?!
If it weren't for you, we probably would have...</b>

21:11.921 --> 21:15.641
<b>Let's talk later.
I'm really glad that you're okay.</b>

21:16.881 --> 21:20.261
<b>By the way,
where are Pedro and Carrot-<i>chan</i>?</b>

21:25.271 --> 21:26.221
<b>Um...</b>

21:26.601 --> 21:31.321
<b>Oh, th-they're sleeping inside!
They both got exhausted from fighting...</b>

21:33.691 --> 21:35.611
<b>Big Bro Peros, what should we do?!</b>

21:35.611 --> 21:38.081
<b>Straw Hat's ship or Mama, 
which one should we chase?!</b>

21:39.491 --> 21:44.871
<b>We won't let the Straw Hats get away,
but Mama's side has Bege.</b>

21:44.871 --> 21:51.341
<b>He's the mastermind who fooled us, betrayed us,
and tried to kill Mama!</b>

21:51.341 --> 21:53.971
<b>We can't let him get away...</b>

21:53.971 --> 21:57.291
<b>Ring, ring, ring... Ring, ring, ring...</b>

21:57.271 --> 21:58.231
<b>Clank.</b>

21:59.261 --> 22:01.691
<b>This is... Bege...</b>

22:02.141 --> 22:04.361
<b>Bege!</b>

22:10.271 --> 22:11.871
<b>Rainfall Mochi!</b>

22:31.581 --> 22:34.721
<b>It seems like it'll be over soon at last...</b>

22:36.341 --> 22:40.351
<b>That bloodied, disgusting monkey...</b>

22:49.351 --> 22:51.031
<b>Take this.</b>

23:09.541 --> 23:14.271
<b><i>Finally exercising his Color of Observation,
Luffy aims to bring down Katakuri.</i></b>

23:14.271 --> 23:18.491
<b><i><i>However, an assassin, Flampe, 
sneaks up to attack him!</i></i></b>

23:18.491 --> 23:22.261
<b><i><i>The unanticipated enemy corners Luffy again
</i></i></b>

23:22.261 --> 23:25.601
<b><i>and Katakuri's formidable
