<b>I possess them both!
No one can compete with me now!</b>

16:38.201 --> 16:41.501
<b>I'm the strongest man in the world!</b>

16:42.541 --> 16:46.191
<b><i>Thus, Teech who ripped off the power
from Whitebeard...</i></b>

16:46.191 --> 16:51.091
<b><i>...would later be known to the world
as one of the Four Emperors.</i></b>

16:55.681 --> 16:57.561
<b>--Marco...
--Marco-<i>san</i>...</b>

16:57.561 --> 16:59.101
<b>...I got bad stiff shoulders...</b>

16:57.661 --> 17:00.251
<b>CAT VIPER - MINK TRIBE GUARDIANS</b>

16:59.101 --> 17:00.391
<b>Marco, at the mountain...</b>

17:00.391 --> 17:02.271
<b>Marco, the vegetables in my field...</b>

17:02.271 --> 17:05.151
<b>Marco, my back hurts again!</b>

17:05.151 --> 17:08.991
<b>--Marco-<i>chan</i>, my knees...
--Marco, help me study...</b>

17:08.991 --> 17:11.361
<b>Marco, my little brother is mean to me!</b>

17:11.741 --> 17:16.371
<b>All right-<i>yoi</i>.
I'm gonna listen to you all in order-<i>yoi</i>.</b>

17:34.841 --> 17:38.011
<b>This is the village Pops built-<i>yoi</i>...</b>

17:38.011 --> 17:42.061
<b>The good old man Whitebeard?
What do you mean by that?</b>

17:44.521 --> 17:46.201
<b>Because of their extreme poverty,</b>

17:46.771 --> 17:50.971
<b>they can't pay their Heavenly Tribute
and affiliate themselves with the World Government...</b>

17:51.651 --> 17:54.361
<b>That's how it goes with
the non-affiliated countries.</b>

17:54.361 --> 17:59.661
<b>Pirates and kidnappers do as they like
and those islands become lawless.</b>

18:00.991 --> 18:04.931
<b>The countries go to ruin
and tons of children become orphans...</b>

18:04.931 --> 18:08.031
<b>Pops was one of those children-yoi.</b>

18:10.291 --> 18:14.541
<b>He set out to sea at an early age.</b>

18:20.561 --> 18:24.021
<b>Even after he became a pirate,
he cared about this island</b>

18:24.021 --> 18:29.261
<b>and continued sending dirty money and resources
without revealing his identity...</b>

18:29.941 --> 18:31.381
<b>...for the rest of his life.</b>

18:32.861 --> 18:37.341
<b>Even though he didn't have a family from the start
and all his friends were gone,</b>

18:37.341 --> 18:39.371
<b>this was his home.</b>

18:41.951 --> 18:46.911
<b>In this corrupt world,
there's no such a thing as clean money!</b>

18:48.961 --> 18:50.481
<b>Thank you-<i>yoi</i>...</b>

18:53.381 --> 18:55.091
<b>After the Paramount War,</b>

18:56.511 --> 19:01.621
<b>we at least tried to defend
the things that Pops was protecting</b>

19:01.621 --> 19:05.791
<b>so we started the Grudge War against Blackbeard
who came to invade our territory...</b>

19:22.911 --> 19:27.481
<b>But we were no match for Teech
since he even got Pops' fruit-power.</b>

19:42.931 --> 19:46.161
<b>He took everything away...</b>

19:52.101 --> 19:56.651
<b>I wanted to beat the hell 
out of that ingrate...</b>

20:03.031 --> 20:04.341
<b>Pops was...</b>

20:07.121 --> 20:10.291
<b>He was actually stingy, wasn't he?</b>

20:18.551 --> 20:20.681
<b>He often wanted other people's drinks</b>

20:21.511 --> 20:24.141
<b>and never bought us drinks!</b>

20:28.561 --> 20:33.311
<b>That's because he was passing
all of his share of treasure to this village...</b>

20:36.151 --> 20:37.781
<b>All of us knew it!</b>

20:39.821 --> 20:41.861
<b>I see...</b>

20:42.991 --> 20:49.081
<b>So this village is the last memento
that he left behind.</b>

20:49.871 --> 20:50.801
<b>Yeah...</b>

20:53.791 --> 20:54.921
<b>And...</b>

20:55.921 --> 20:58.781
<b>...Red-Haired buried him nearby...</b>

21:01.171 --> 21:02.591
<b>By the way,</b>

21:02.591 --> 21:07.911
<b>a Warlord named Weevil
is proclaiming he's Pops' biological son</b>

21:07.911 --> 21:10.641
<b>and attacking people connected to Whitebeard.</b>

21:11.851 --> 21:14.251
<b>Mommy! Mommy!</b>

21:14.251 --> 21:17.211
<b>I'm Whitebeard's son, right?!</b>

21:17.211 --> 21:19.111
<b>My beard's white as well!</b>

21:19.111 --> 21:21.031
<b>That's right, dear!</b>

21:21.031 --> 21:27.251
<b>You're the only biological son of
the world's strongest pirate, Whitebeard!</b>

21:27.251 --> 21:28.491
<b>Uh-huh! Uh-huh!</b>

21:28.491 --> 21:30.871
<b>And I'm...</b>

21:31.831 --> 21:34.161
<b>...the woman who Whitebeard loved!</b>

21:35.331 --> 21:37.501
<b>Oh, is that true?!</b>

21:37.501 --> 21:40.881
<b>It's a man-loves-woman thing
so I don't know for sure,</b>

21:40.881 --> 21:44.881
<b>but I guess they're after his fortune.</b>

21:44.881 --> 21:48.061
<b>They won't take our word for 
it that there isn't any.</b>

21:49.261 --> 21:53.691
<b>Both this place and I will become their target
sooner or later-<i>yoi</i>.</b>

21:53.691 --> 21:55.061
<b>I see.</b>

21:55.421 --> 21:57.791
<b>Then you can't leave-<i>meow</i>.</b>

22:01.531 --> 22:05.171
<b>Weevil's mother Buckin used to be a pirate.</b>

22:05.171 --> 22:11.911
<b>I know 30-something years or nearly 40 years ago,
she was on the same ship with Pops.</b>

22:15.001 --> 22:18.541
<b>Then, maybe he's also a memento
that should be protected.</b>

22:21.091 --> 22:23.971
<b>His behavior tells me otherwise-<i>yoi</i>!</b>

22:23.971 --> 22:25.171
<b>You're right!</b>

22:29.851 --> 22:35.481
<b>If you're going to see Straw Hat Luffy,
I want you to pass on a message, Cat Viper.</b>

22:35.481 --> 22:37.941
<b>Yeah, no problem.</b>

22:37.941 --> 22:40.991
<b>--You said you're gonna go to the Land of Wano?
--Yeah.</b>

22:40.991 --> 22:43.691
<b>What are you planning to do there?</b>

22:46.491 --> 22:48.951
<b>We'll take down Kaido!</b>

22:50.371 --> 22:52.401
<b>The Emperor of the Sea - Kaido?!</b>

22:55.001 --> 22:59.961
<b>Luffy, that fool...
Is he gonna pick a fight with Kaido this time?!</b>

23:05.921 --> 23:08.991
<b><i><i>The Straw Hats enter an unknown sea area!</i></i></b>

23:08.991 --> 23:12.721
