<b>Come on! Let's do it!</b>

19:09.421 --> 19:11.421
<b>Mama, are you listening?</b>

19:12.421 --> 19:16.391
<b>What?! Their ship hasn't sunk yet?!</b>

19:16.431 --> 19:18.251
<b>Are you sure, Brulee?!</b>

19:18.251 --> 19:20.771
<b><i>Yeah, I heard their voices!</i></b>

19:21.261 --> 19:25.641
<b>But the candy monster made a high wave
and swallowed them!</b>

19:26.111 --> 19:28.781
<b>How did they escape?!</b>

19:31.351 --> 19:33.231

19:46.971 --> 19:50.331
<b><i>...that it's our final destination, too!</i></b>

19:51.661 --> 19:56.641
<b>Mama! The cake that you crave
is in Chocolat Town, Cacao Island!</b>

19:59.101 --> 20:02.071
<b><i>I lied to her out of desperation,</i></b>

20:02.621 --> 20:07.531
