<b>Are you toying with us

<b>Man, I'm hungry! You got any food?</b>

11:40.141 --> 11:41.571
<b>Listen when people are talking!</b>

11:41.571 --> 11:43.571
<b>You damn kid!</b>

11:44.491 --> 11:45.581

12:00.381 --> 12:02.681
<b>--W-Who <i>are</i> you?!

12:07.221 --> 12:13.301
<b>That day, I got in a boat

12:31.371 --> 12:33.591
<b>If you don't like it, then run away!</b>

12:33.591 --> 12:35.651
<b>I-I can't! No way! No way!</b>

12:35.651 --> 12:39.291
<b>Just the thought of Alvida-<i>sama</i> finding me

12:47.971 --> 12:50.911
<b>Yeah... That's right...</b>

12:50.911 --> 12:55.541
<b>If only I had the courage

<b>K-King of the Pirates is the title given to the person

<b>Just because.
It's not about whether I can or not.</b>

14:26.911 --> 14:28.031
<b>What?</b>

14:28.031 --> 14:29.451
<b>I'm gonna do it because I want to.</b>

16:28.781 --> 16:31.701
<b>Is it true that you are pirates?!</b>

16:31.701 --> 16:37.031
<b>Yeah. We gained a member

16:37.351 --> 16:44.001
<b>We appreciate that you saved our base

<b>Well? Is he?!</b>

17:22.251 --> 17:26.131
<b>I know what he's done until now.</b>

17:27.251 --> 17:29.091
<b><i>Luffy-</i>san<i>! You wouldn't!</i></b>

17:47.521 --> 17:50.691
<b><i>Please don't! Please don't!</i></b>

17:55.111 --> 17:57.321

18:00.391 --> 18:01.411
<b>Ouch!</b>

18:02.081 --> 18:05.621
<b>Hey! You've gone too far. That's enough.</b>

18:08.711 --> 18:12.191
<b>It's very clear that you

18:12.191 --> 18:14.341

18:20.561 --> 18:21.661
<b><i>On purpose...</i></b>

18:23.061 --> 18:25.101
<b><i>He did that on purpose...</i></b>

18:27.151 --> 18:28.771
<b><i>For me...</i></b>

18:29.101 --> 18:33.031
<b><i>He purposely got me riled up

<b><i>Please! Please!</i></b>

18:44.581 --> 18:49.541
<b>Let me join the Navy!
I'll gladly do chores or anything else!</b>

18:49.891 --> 18:51.841
<b>If it means I can be a Navy soldier!</b>

18:54.421 --> 18:56.801
<b>Commander! I'm against the idea!</b>

18:57.271 --> 19:00.091
<b>I still don't fully trust this kid!</b>

19:00.091 --> 19:03.471
<b>There <i>have</i> been cases of Navy
