16:25.671 --> 16:28.881
<b>And now, the Straw Hats...</b>

16:28.921 --> 16:34.261
<b>...have become the most prominent pirate group
in the sea world...</b>

16:34.431 --> 16:36.101
<b>They're a huge success.</b>

16:36.471 --> 16:41.101
<b>Yeah, if it weren't for Kuma,
they would've never made it.</b>

16:41.601 --> 16:44.061
<b>But as a consequence, he became...</b>

16:44.941 --> 16:47.321
<b>He's our special comrade.</b>

16:48.021 --> 16:51.951
<b>I have to return the favor
for what he did for my brother!</b>

16:53.411 --> 16:57.661
<b>Let's save Kuma-<i>chan</i> - our dear friend!</b>

17:13.431 --> 17:15.511
<b>Why are you laughing?</b>

17:16.261 --> 17:17.721
<b>The wanted poster?</b>

17:21.101 --> 17:24.981
<b>Well, his bounty tripled,
from 500 million to 1.5 billion...</b>

17:25.271 --> 17:28.441
<b>That's the bounty of a great pirate.</b>

17:30.481 --> 17:32.941
<b>Oh, it's News Coo.</b>

17:33.531 --> 17:36.111
<b>WORLD CONFERENCE CONVENES TODAY</b>

17:34.031 --> 17:36.111
<b>It finally starts.</b>

17:36.281 --> 17:37.661
<b>What does?</b>

17:38.201 --> 17:39.701
<b>The Reverie.</b>

17:39.911 --> 17:40.991
<b><i>And...</i></b>

17:41.791 --> 17:46.081
<b>HOLYLAND OF MARIEJOIS</b>

17:42.331 --> 17:46.081
<b><i>...it's finally time for the Reverie!</i></b>

17:46.291 --> 17:49.501
<b>PANGAEA CASTLE</b>

17:47.461 --> 17:49.501
<b><i>The sea world is divided in four...</i></b>

17:50.881 --> 17:53.671
<b><i>...by the high wall - the Red Line...</i></b>

17:53.721 --> 17:58.511
<b><i>and the dangerous sea - the Grand Line...</i></b>

17:55.971 --> 18:02.471
<b>EAST BLUE          NORTH BLUE</b>

17:55.971 --> 18:02.471
<b>MARIEJOIS                       NEW WORLD




SOUTH BLUE         WEST BLUE</b>

17:58.551 --> 18:02.471
<b><i>...in which Luffy and the others are traveling.</i></b>

18:03.181 --> 18:06.901
<b><i>And the World Government
is a huge organization...</i></b>

18:06.941 --> 18:10.861
<b><i>...which is affiliated with 170 countries,
the majority of the world.</i></b>

18:11.821 --> 18:19.781
<b><i>Among them, 50 representative kings and queens
assemble at this Holyland every four years.</i></b>

18:26.461 --> 18:28.831
<b>W-Where's my seat?!</b>

18:36.381 --> 18:38.841
<b>--Finally.
--Yeah.</b>

18:39.011 --> 18:44.351
<b>How's your country been?
You said it was ravaged by pirates four years ago...</b>

18:44.521 --> 18:48.851
<b>Thanks to Fleet Admiral Sakazuki,
they've been sent to Impel Down.</b>

18:48.901 --> 18:54.111
<b>Speaking of pirates, I often hear one name lately.
I think it's...</b>

18:54.281 --> 18:56.241
<b>Straw Hat Luffy, right?</b>

18:57.571 --> 19:03.991
<b>He attempted to kill Big Mom and rumor has it that
he's going after Kaido next.</b>

19:04.161 --> 19:08.751
<b>Kaido?! Does that mean the Land of Wano
will be in turmoil next?</b>

19:08.921 --> 19:14.421
<b>The Land of Wano is not affiliated with the World Government
so it's lawless.</b>

19:14.631 --> 19:19.431
<b>We don't know if it's even proper
to call it a country.</b>

19:19.681 --> 19:22.681
<b>Is there anything we can do?!</b>

19:22.971 --> 19:27.311
<b>Sending the Navy costs money.</b>

19:31.311 --> 19:37.281
<b>How could he cause problem after problem,
that Straw Hat Luffy.</b>

19:37.441 --> 19:39.491
<b>Can't believe it, huh?</b>

19:40.281 --> 19:42.161
<b>What's so funny, Prodence?</b>

19:43.071 --> 19:45.121
<b><i>Luffy-</i>kun<i>...</i></b>

19:45.741 --> 19:48.081
<b>The chairman is chosen in turn.</b>

19:48.251 --> 19:49.961
<b>Who is it this time?</b>

19:50.751 --> 19:52.291
<b>It's me!</b>

19:52.331 --> 19:54.461
<b>Thank you very much.</b>

19:54.631 --> 19:56.171
<b>It's Ballywood.</b>

19:56.341 --> 19:57.841
<b>Sounds good.</b>

19:58.011 --> 20:01.221
<b>I think you'll run everything efficiently.</b>

20:01.381 --> 20:05.051
<b>Even if we have a full seven days,
we have so many things to discuss.</b>

20:05.221 --> 20:08.601
<b><i>The big conference where they decide
the direction of the world.</i></b>

20:09.351 --> 20:12.691
<b><i>It is called...</i></b>

20:13.651 --> 20:17.691
<b>All right. Let's have a good debate as always.</b>

20:19.151 --> 20:25.121
<b>For the sake of this beautiful world!
Kings and queens of various countries!</b>

20:29.951 --> 20:31.711
<b><i>...The Reverie!</i></b>

20:32.671 --> 20:35.671
<b>It seems like the conference has begun...</b>

20:35.841 --> 20:42.551
<b>During this congress, Cobra, the king of Alabasta,
is requesting to see us, too.</b>

20:42.761 --> 20:44.681
<b>The Nefeltari Family...</b>

20:44.721 --> 20:51.481
<b>...was the only family of the First Twenty,
who stayed in the lower world 800 years ago.</b>

20:51.641 --> 20:56.271
<b>In a sense, they're betrayers.
Has he noticed something?</b>

20:56.311 --> 20:59.361
<b>Let's hope things don't become complicated.</b>

20:59.781 --> 21:03.451
<b>You can say the same about
Big Mom and Kaido's problem.</b>

21:03.491 --> 21:09.371
<b>It's been two years since the Paramount War...
The swell is unstoppable now.</b>

21:09.541 --> 21:14.751
<b>The balance of the world can't be maintained forever.</b>

21:14.791 --> 21:20.511
<b>We need to clean it up thoroughly soon.</b>

21:27.511 --> 21:32.351
<b>INSIDE PANGAEA CASTLE
CHAMBER OF FLOWERS</b>

21:32.521 --> 21:34.021
<b>Imu-<i>sama</i>.</b>

21:34.061 --> 21:36.691
<b>They are all here.</b>

22:36.791 --> 22:41.211
<b>Have you decided which "light"
needs to be extinguished...</b>

22:41.381 --> 22:43.921
<b>...From history this time?</b>

22:47.631 --> 22:50.851
<b>If so, share the name with us!</b>

23:06.691 --> 23:11.661
<b><i>Cat Viper and his clan meet Marco at Whitebeard's homeland.
Will Marco stand up again?!</i></b>

23:11.821 --> 23:16.161
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!

23:16.201 --> 23:19.541
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>

23:21.211 --> 23:24.921
<b>I'm gonna kick the Emperor of the Sea, Kaido's butt!</b>

23:25.961 --> 23:29.841
