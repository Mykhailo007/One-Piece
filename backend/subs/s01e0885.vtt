12:31.001 --> 12:32.421
<b>What? No...</b>

12:33.791 --> 12:37.341
<b>Listen, Dalton! You bastard in shining armor!</b>

12:37.341 --> 12:41.381
<b>You can't be naive when running a country!</b>

12:41.381 --> 12:44.221
<b>I'm living proof since I came back by making</b>

12:44.221 --> 12:47.491
<b>a fortune with my Munch-Munch Fruit power!</b>

12:47.491 --> 12:51.561
<b>The higher you climb,
the more you'll see how dirty this world is!</b>

12:51.931 --> 12:54.731
<b>I'll teach you! And pay you back...</b>

12:54.731 --> 12:58.321
<b>By the way, did you read 
the article on Luffy-<i>kun</i>?</b>

12:58.511 --> 13:00.361
<b>Yes, thoroughly.</b>

13:00.441 --> 13:03.151
<b>Say, maybe... Dalton-<i>san</i>...</b>

13:04.641 --> 13:06.491
<b>You like Lucy?</b>

13:06.491 --> 13:08.581
<b>You like Luffyland, don't you?</b>

13:12.661 --> 13:13.751
<b>I like him very much.</b>

13:14.621 --> 13:16.001
<b>This is gonna be fun!</b>

13:16.541 --> 13:18.671
<b>Are you guys listening?!</b>

13:18.671 --> 13:22.421
<b>You, old witch hag,
how much longer are you gonna live?!</b>

13:22.421 --> 13:25.641
<b>You're way over 150!</b>

13:26.761 --> 13:30.181
<b>I'm still a spry 141!</b>

13:31.141 --> 13:33.141
<b>By the way, ladies...</b>

13:35.481 --> 13:38.361
<b>Did you see that blue-nosed reindeer?</b>

13:38.581 --> 13:40.731
<b>Yes, I saw him!</b>

13:42.401 --> 13:45.431
<b>In the Ryugu Kingdom, he saved Luffy-<i>sama</i></b>

13:45.431 --> 13:48.291
<b>who was critically injured as 
well as the kingdom itself.</b>

13:52.041 --> 13:53.521
<b>I see.</b>

13:56.541 --> 14:00.001
<b><i>Please... teach me to be a doctor!</i></b>

14:00.091 --> 14:05.381
<b>I'll become the all-purpose medicine!
I'll become a doctor who can cure anything!</b>

14:05.381 --> 14:08.261
<b>I'll cure even a country!</b>

14:09.051 --> 14:14.101
<b>Because...
there's no disease in this world that can't be cured!</b>

14:35.751 --> 14:39.421
<b>Hey, let's be pirates together!</b>

14:39.421 --> 14:40.211
<b>Okay?!</b>

14:40.781 --> 14:41.671
<b>It's not possible.</b>

14:42.171 --> 14:43.261
<b>Because...</b>

14:46.221 --> 14:51.681
<b>Because I'm a reindeer! I 
have antlers and hooves!</b>

14:52.051 --> 14:53.351
<b>I even have a blue nose!</b>

14:53.751 --> 14:58.311
<b>I'm not even a human! I'm a monster!</b>

14:58.311 --> 15:02.861
<b>I can't become your friend! So...!</b>

15:02.861 --> 15:04.321
<b>So I just came to say thank you...</b>

15:05.031 --> 15:08.071
<b>I do appreciate you guys.</b>

15:09.161 --> 15:11.861
<b>Thank you for asking me to join you.</b>

15:12.531 --> 15:15.511
<b>I'll stay here, but...</b>

15:16.201 --> 15:19.251
<b>one day... if you feel 
like it, stop by agai...</b>

15:19.251 --> 15:22.581
<b>Shut up! Let's go!</b>

15:29.131 --> 15:30.841
<b>I have something to talk with you!</b>

15:31.071 --> 15:37.641
<b>Listen, Doctorine! I'm gonna be a pirate.
I'm going with them!</b>

15:37.971 --> 15:39.691
<b>Don't be ridiculous!</b>

15:41.311 --> 15:46.031
<b>I've never heard of a mere reindeer
going out to sea.</b>

15:46.031 --> 15:48.951
<b>That's right. I'm a reindeer! But...</b>

15:49.121 --> 15:50.301
<b>I'm a man, too!</b>

15:55.411 --> 15:59.291
<b>What do you think someone like you
can do at sea?!</b>

15:59.291 --> 16:02.541
<b>Are you gonna live in a fantasy
just like that quack did?!</b>

16:02.731 --> 16:05.341
<b>You're wrong! It wasn't a fantasy!</b>

16:05.921 --> 16:09.171
<b>Doctor's research had 
actually been completed!</b>

16:14.601 --> 16:17.691
<b>Was it okay to bid farewell like that?</b>

16:20.691 --> 16:25.341
<b>A pet I was taking care of is being taken in
by someone else. That's all.</b>

16:26.571 --> 16:29.861
<b>I don't like... tears...</b>

16:36.491 --> 16:39.121
<b>Are you ready, young men?!</b>

16:47.001 --> 16:49.671
<b><i>I will make cherry blossoms bloom.</i></b>

16:49.671 --> 16:54.031
<b><i>Once my invention is completed,
this country will be saved!</i></b>

16:54.791 --> 16:58.511
<b><i>Doctor...! Doctorine...!</i></b>

17:23.371 --> 17:27.091
<b><i>Now, have a safe trip, my stupid son...</i></b>

17:43.481 --> 17:44.561
<b>Ouch!</b>

17:44.991 --> 17:45.941
<b>What happened?!</b>

17:46.551 --> 17:50.691
<b>I tried to help Sanji cook
and I cut my finger...</b>

17:50.691 --> 17:51.571
<b>Let me see.</b>

17:52.901 --> 17:56.701
<b>You're fine. It won't take long to heal!
It'll sting a bit.</b>

17:59.701 --> 18:01.531
<b>Chobro, you're great!</b>

18:01.531 --> 18:02.121
<b>What?</b>

18:02.121 --> 18:06.001
<b>Because there's no injury
you can't treat.</b>

18:06.001 --> 18:09.961
<b>Luffy was all cut up
but now he's totally fine!</b>

18:10.671 --> 18:14.881
<b>That's because I was taught
by the greatest doctor in the world!</b>

18:19.511 --> 18:21.341
<b>It's a nice day.</b>

18:22.561 --> 18:23.471
<b>Leo.</b>

18:24.161 --> 18:27.961
<b>I've been working for the Kano 
Kingdom, but I'll cut ties</b>

18:27.961 --> 18:31.271
<b>with them after this bodyguard duty.</b>

18:31.631 --> 18:34.501
<b>This will be my last service for them.</b>

18:35.111 --> 18:39.981
<b>I'm deeply indebted to Straw Hat and the others
for saving us in Dressrosa.</b>

18:40.701 --> 18:46.291
<b>We're seven representatives of the Straw Hat Fleet
with over 5,600 troops in total.</b>

18:46.291 --> 18:50.211
<b>We have to be ready to help him at all times.</b>

18:50.421 --> 18:51.451
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

18:52.381 --> 18:56.131
<b>I heard the other members 
started preparing, too.</b>

19:03.181 --> 19:04.521
<b>What did you say?!</b>

19:03.811 --> 19:05.561
<b>RESIGNATION</b>

19:04.521 --> 19:08.771
<b>You're suddenly leaving 
the Standing Kingdom?!</b>

19:08.771 --> 19:10.521
<b>Give me a reason!</b>

19:10.521 --> 19:13.271
<b>I have to pay back a great debt!</b>

19:13.271 --> 19:14.321
<b>Barrier!</b>

19:15.231 --> 19:17.261
<b>Barrier Crush!</b>

19:19.361 --> 19:22.711
<b>Just by crossing fingers, 
anyone can put up a barrier!</b>

19:22.711 --> 19:24.871
<b>Even children know that!</b>

19:25.661 --> 19:27.461
<b>W-We surrender!</b>

19:27.641 --> 19:31.921
<b>We lose! We'll serve under you
so give us a break!</b>

19:33.291 --> 19:34.201
<b>Well then...</b>

19:34.591 --> 19:35.801
<b>Put this on.</b>

19:37.051 --> 19:38.551
<b>Wh-What is it?</b>

19:40.591 --> 19:44.141
<b>Let's support the Straw Hats together!</b>

19:44.141 --> 19:45.221
<b>Let's!</b>

19:49.391 --> 19:52.401
<b>Two unidentified ships are approaching!</b>

19:52.671 --> 19:54.981
<b>Are they remnants of Doflamingo's troops?</b>

19:56.111 --> 19:57.321
<b>Cavendish.</b>

19:57.321 --> 19:59.491
<b>As you may know,</b>

20:00.361 --> 20:04.081
<b>I was formerly the prince of
the Bourgeois Kingdom.</b>

20:05.831 --> 20:08.821
<b>Cavendish-<i>sama</i>!</b>

20:09.331 --> 20:14.011
<b>But all the women in the country
were crazy about me</b>

20:14.501 --> 20:17.461
<b>and not one of them was 
willing to marry other men...</b>

20:17.781 --> 20:22.931
<b>I was expelled from the country
for being too popular.</b>

20:23.641 --> 20:25.101
<b>So...</b>

20:25.501 --> 20:29.481
<b>It's not necessary to attack them
since they're not our enemies.</b>

20:33.401 --> 20:37.001
<b>I know that Straw Hat 
will face those who are</b>

20:37.001 --> 20:40.781
<b>more dangerous than Doflamingo hereafter.</b>

20:40.781 --> 20:43.781
<b>We have to become stronger.</b>

20:43.781 --> 20:47.741
<b>Yes! I'm training myself with my crew, too!</b>

20:47.741 --> 20:51.711
<b>I hope we can fight for 
Luffyland together again!</b>

20:51.991 --> 20:53.041
<b>Yep!</b>

20:59.461 --> 21:02.941
<b><i>The Underwater Prison Impel Down...</i></b>

21:01.011 --> 21:05.091
<b>THE UNDERWATER PRISON IMPEL DOWN</b>

21:10.271 --> 21:11.981
<b><i>The lowest level...</i></b>

21:11.981 --> 21:16.451
<b><i>Level 6 holds the criminals

21:18.071 --> 21:19.671
<b><i>The Infinite Hell.</i></b>

21:25.281 --> 21:28.081
<b>What's this solitary cell?</b>

21:28.391 --> 21:32.041
<b>Am I all alone here? I feel so lonely.</b>

21:32.041 --> 21:36.461
<b>Don't tell me you're trying 
to protect me, Magellan!</b>

21:38.491 --> 21:42.181
<b>Did an assassin from on high come to kill me?</b>

21:42.811 --> 21:48.471
<b>In order to prevent me from telling someone
about the secret of Mariejois,</b>

21:48.471 --> 21:52.771
<b>did they send an assassin to silence me?!</b>

21:57.561 --> 22:02.781
<b>Why does it matter if it's revealed now?
Power doesn't last long.</b>

22:02.781 --> 22:05.631
<b>It'll rot faster than anyone thinks!</b>

22:08.241 --> 22:11.331
<b>MARIEJOIS</b>

23:09.891 --> 23:14.181

23:21.621 --> 23:26.361
<b>However, it comes to a stunning end!</b>

23:27.691 --> 23:30.601
<b>"The Holyland in Tumult! The
