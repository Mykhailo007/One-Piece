this cake-making will be...</b>

16:07.241 --> 16:08.411
<b><i>Husband and wife?!</i></b>

16:08.411 --> 16:12.501
<b>...your first joint work, strangely enough.</b>

16:13.391 --> 16:15.771
<b>Yeah, it will be. I feel awkward.</b>

16:15.771 --> 16:17.841
<b>Husband and wife...</b>

16:17.841 --> 16:19.881
<b>You okay, Missis-<i>sama</i>?!</b>

16:19.881 --> 16:21.451
<b>M... Missi...</b>

16:21.451 --> 16:22.321
<b>Missis-<i>sama</i>!</b>

16:22.881 --> 16:24.721
<b>Missis-<i>sama</i>! Missis-<i>sama</i>!</b>

16:24.721 --> 16:26.581
<b>Stay with us, Missi...</b>

16:26.581 --> 16:28.291
<b>Stop! She's gonna die!</b>

16:28.291 --> 16:29.391
<b>What?!</b>

16:30.161 --> 16:33.041
<b><i>He called us husband and wife! Oh my!</i></b>

16:33.041 --> 16:34.391
<b>Hey!</b>

16:34.391 --> 16:37.561
<b><i>What? Suddenly, he said, "Hey" to me...</i></b>

16:37.561 --> 16:41.521
<b><i>Maybe it's not so bad to have a husband
who wears the pants in the house.</i></b>

16:41.521 --> 16:44.701
<b><i>No, but it's important to start things right.</i></b>

16:45.171 --> 16:50.481
<b>I-If you act like my master,
I'll kill you, Sanji...</b>

16:50.481 --> 16:52.241
<b>I need some stuff in a hurry.</b>

16:52.241 --> 16:57.081
<b>Non-homogenized milk, sugar beets,
bananas, black sesame,</b>

16:57.081 --> 17:00.321
<b>roasted soy flour, yogurt.
A lot of it.</b>

17:00.321 --> 17:01.521
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

17:02.571 --> 17:04.381
<b><i>...san</i>!</b>

17:05.951 --> 17:10.551
<b>Everyone! It's a race against time
until the cake is complete!</b>

17:10.551 --> 17:15.351
<b>Chiffon-<i>chan</i>, you bake 
the giant chiffon cake.</b>

17:15.351 --> 17:19.461
<b>Pudding-<i>chan</i>,
you handle all the chocolate tempering.</b>

17:20.561 --> 17:23.401
<b>You have two hours and forty minutes!</b>

17:23.401 --> 17:26.781
<b>It certainly is a fight against time.</b>

17:26.781 --> 17:31.491
<b>When we get there,
I'll add my secret ingredient!</b>

17:31.971 --> 17:35.291
<b>It leads anyone to the peak of happiness...</b>

17:35.291 --> 17:38.341
<b>I'll make you taste true sweetness!</b>

17:38.341 --> 17:41.841
<b>T-True sweetness?!</b>

17:41.841 --> 17:47.471
<b>In three hours, we'll load the incomplete cake
on a ship and leave Cacao Island.</b>

17:47.471 --> 17:51.121
<b>And as we let it cool down,
we'll decorate it on the ship.</b>

17:52.181 --> 17:56.561
<b>Before we meet up with Luffy and the others
being chased by Big Mom, at the Sunny,</b>

17:56.561 --> 17:59.281
<b>we'll finish making the greatest cake ever!</b>

17:59.811 --> 18:02.261
<b>I see. That sounds efficient.</b>

18:02.261 --> 18:06.431
<b>--But at a pace like that?
--No matter how you look at it, that's impossible!</b>

18:06.431 --> 18:09.821
<b>We gotta do it!
Do you want Mama to destroy the country?!</b>

18:09.821 --> 18:12.991
<b>I'm sorry! We'll follow you!</b>

18:14.681 --> 18:16.091
<b>All right!</b>

18:16.441 --> 18:17.961
<b>Let's start baking!</b>

18:19.331 --> 18:21.851
<b><i>For those who saved Lola!</i></b>

18:22.901 --> 18:24.921
<b><i>For Sanji-</i>san<i>!</i></b>

18:24.921 --> 18:31.181
<b><i>I'll make my special extremely-fluffy
chiffon cake!</i></b>

18:31.491 --> 18:34.391
<b><i>I must help Sanji-</i>san \<i>Nand the others get away!</i></b>

18:34.391 --> 18:37.411
<b><i>With my very sweet chocolate!</i></b>

18:38.621 --> 18:41.601
<b><i>Keep hanging on, guys!</i></b>

18:42.631 --> 18:44.151
<b><i>I'll show them!</i></b>

18:45.001 --> 18:47.111
<b><i>My bold cooking!</i></b>

18:49.971 --> 18:53.821
<b><i>How he died was so pathetic!</i></b>

18:53.821 --> 18:56.661
<b><i>That Pedro guy.</i></b>

18:56.661 --> 19:00.041
<b><i>Straw Hat! You saw it too, right?</i></b>

19:02.351 --> 19:08.551
<b><i>I guess he tried to kill me
by sacrificing his worthless life,</i></b>

19:08.551 --> 19:11.591
<b>but I'm very much alive as you hear.</b>

19:12.341 --> 19:16.141
<b><i>So he died for absolutely nothing!
Right?!</i></b>

19:16.831 --> 19:20.891
<b><i>It is decided that you're gonna die in vain, too,
just like Pedro.</i></b>

19:20.891 --> 19:24.611
<b><i>Why don't you let him kill you already?
Lick.</i></b>

19:25.001 --> 19:26.151
<b>Clank.</b>

19:26.541 --> 19:28.341
<b>Hey, Brulee.</b>

19:30.631 --> 19:33.101
<b>Oh, Big Bro.</b>

19:33.101 --> 19:38.231
<b>Just wake up already.
Our soldiers can't go anywhere if you're sleeping.</b>

19:38.231 --> 19:39.121
<b>Okay.</b>

19:39.121 --> 19:43.871
<b>Just when I thought he saved his crew valiantly,
look how he is now.</b>

19:45.541 --> 19:46.461
<b>B...</b>

19:46.461 --> 19:48.511
<b>B... Big Bro!</b>

20:01.331 --> 20:05.141
<b>You couldn't beat me
with your speed and power.</b>

20:05.141 --> 20:08.771
<b>What are you gonna use next, Straw Hat?</b>

20:16.091 --> 20:18.871
<b>How boring. You're gonna just use both.</b>

20:24.851 --> 20:28.031
<b>You must know your capabilities by now.</b>

20:28.031 --> 20:30.341
<b>Gum-Gum...</b>

20:30.341 --> 20:34.071
<b>...Elephant Gatling!</b>

20:40.561 --> 20:41.771
<b>Too slow!</b>

20:49.461 --> 20:50.521
<b>Too light!</b>

20:55.751 --> 20:59.951
<b>You have no ability that's better than mine!</b>

21:37.171 --> 21:39.601
<b>Straw Hat finally gave up.</b>

21:39.601 --> 21:41.411
<b>What a pathetic end.</b>

21:44.181 --> 21:49.191
<b>Brulee! Take those soldiers
and go set fire or something to Straw Hat's ship.</b>

21:49.191 --> 21:50.211
<b>Okay!</b>

21:50.211 --> 21:51.971
<b>Big Sis Brulee!</b>

21:51.971 --> 21:55.361
<b>We found a mirror that 
links to Straw Hat's ship!</b>

21:52.191 --> 21:57.321
<b>MARSCARPONE - 34TH SON OF CHARLOTTE
JOSCARPONE - 29TH DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE</b>

21:55.361 --> 21:57.421
<b>There must be one or two more!</b>

21:57.651 --> 22:02.091
<b>All right! Let's shoot flaming arrows
at Straw Hat's ship!</b>

22:02.091 --> 22:07.891
<b>I hope they get done in by Mama
while in a frenzy from the fire.</b>

22:08.751 --> 22:09.691
<b>Yikes!</b>

22:14.461 --> 22:16.591
<b>Give me the mirror!</b>

22:17.171 --> 22:19.451
<b>Leave them alone!</b>

22:20.891 --> 22:24.621
<b>I thought you were in a one-on-one duel with me,
Straw Hat.</b>

22:26.021 --> 22:28.231
<b>Take that!</b>

22:31.941 --> 22:36.711
<b>Now, burn down Straw Hat's ship!</b>

22:37.781 --> 22:39.301
<b>Roger!</b>

22:42.321 --> 22:44.951
<b>Are you ready, Joscar?</b>

22:44.951 --> 22:46.991
<b>I am, Marscar.</b>

22:53.881 --> 22:56.651
<b>Now, shoot them!</b>

23:00.281 --> 23:02.031
<b>Stop!!</b>

23:09.521 --> 23:12.241
<b><i><i>The Emperor of the Sea 
Big Mom's enormous power</i></i></b>

23:12.241 --> 23:15.341
<b><i>allows her to control even 
the raging sea as she likes!</i></b>

23:15.341 --> 23:19.151
<b><i><i>When a big wave as tall as a 
battlement comes for the Sunny,</i></i></b>

23:19.151 --> 23:22.011
<b><i>Nami and the others think 
death is unavoidable,</i></b>

23:22.011 --> 23:25.931
<b><i><i>but Jimbei takes the helm and goes into action
for the sake of the crew!</i></i></b>

23:25.931 --> 23:30.681
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!
"The Green Room! An Invincible Helmsman, Jimbei!"</b>

23:30.681 --> 23:33.111
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
