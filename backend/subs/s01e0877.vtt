<b>Huh? What's that thing around your neck?!</b>

16:55.371 --> 16:58.581
<b>How could you cut my sister's face?!</b>

16:59.421 --> 17:02.051
<b><i>I'll never lower my guard again!</i></b>

17:05.421 --> 17:08.551
<b><i>I'll teach them what true fear is!</i></b>

17:12.601 --> 17:13.701
<b>Brulee...</b>

17:14.931 --> 17:16.401
<b>How's Straw Hat doing?</b>

17:19.311 --> 17:22.861
<b>No doubt you'll think "That's good"
when you hear it.</b>

17:23.321 --> 17:25.941
<b>Can you see ahead into the future, too?</b>

17:28.951 --> 17:31.601
<b>He just made it out of the territory...</b>

17:31.601 --> 17:33.511
<b>I won't forgive him!</b>

17:33.511 --> 17:37.241
<b>He gave you a hard time like this!</b>

17:38.751 --> 17:40.041
<b>I was right.</b>

17:42.841 --> 17:46.471
<b>Luffy and the others left the territory.
Let's retreat!</b>

17:46.631 --> 17:49.641
<b>Retreat! Help the injured!</b>

17:57.601 --> 18:01.151
<b>Germa 66! We'll withdraw!</b>

18:02.231 --> 18:05.861
<b>Shoot, shoot!
Don't let them get away-<i>nie</i>!</b>

18:13.371 --> 18:15.871
<b>Damn Germa!</b>

18:21.001 --> 18:24.761
<b>Their defense on the south side is poor.
Let's get through there!</b>

18:24.761 --> 18:25.461
<b>Yes, sir!</b>

18:40.141 --> 18:41.401
<b>Here she comes...</b>

18:51.071 --> 18:52.411
<b>It's Mama!</b>

18:52.871 --> 18:54.281
<b>Mama is here...</b>

18:54.281 --> 18:56.491
<b>Mama is here!</b>

19:04.171 --> 19:05.421
<b>Jimbei...</b>

19:05.421 --> 19:08.091
<b>I guess they won't just let us go.</b>

19:08.551 --> 19:11.091
<b>Of course, we're ready for it!</b>

19:11.091 --> 19:15.241
<b>I promised Luffy that I'd return alive.</b>

19:15.241 --> 19:18.331
<b>Let's all survive at any cost!</b>

19:18.331 --> 19:20.601
<b>We're at a critical stage!</b>

19:47.341 --> 19:54.301
<b><i>You must ask what they 
want in exchange for it</i></b>

19:56.641 --> 20:08.431
<b><i>There is no gain on our side</i></b>

20:08.431 --> 20:20.661
<b><i>Give them a treat or they'll 
play a trick on you</i></b>

20:20.661 --> 20:32.721
