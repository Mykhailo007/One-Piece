11:09.431 --> 11:15.991
<b>How many days do you think even the head chef, Streusen,

11:16.681 --> 11:22.241
<b>The rare ingredients that we collected

11:22.641 --> 11:28.211
<b>And the person who can bake it is in a coma!

11:30.241 --> 11:36.181
<b>What's more troubling is that

11:36.181 --> 11:38.261
<b>So this time, we have to provide...</b>

11:39.591 --> 11:46.311
<b>The never-before-eaten delicious cake

12:48.831 --> 12:50.961

12:50.961 --> 12:55.451
<b>But Chiffon is married to Bege

12:57.311 --> 12:59.611

12:59.611 --> 13:01.351

13:06.471 --> 13:09.391

13:09.391 --> 13:13.251

13:34.551 --> 13:37.681

13:41.301 --> 13:43.601
<b>If Mama can wipe them out...</b>

<b>Oh? Nami, I thought Lola's Vivre Card
was taken away from you.</b>

15:26.971 --> 15:29.741
<b>Yes, they took it.
But I cut in half just in case.</b>

15:29.741 --> 15:31.001
<b>That's smart!</b>

15:31.001 --> 15:32.911
<b>This is fast!</b>

15:33.251 --> 15:36.831
<b>Since he's the master of the Seducing Woods,
he can travel a straight line!</b>

15:37.131 --> 15:40.551
<b>All right!
Keep going to the Sunny at full speed!</b>

15:40.551 --> 15:41.861
<b>Go!</b>

15:41.861 --> 15:47.231
<b>You guys are like the plague-<i>ju</i>!
Get out of this country already-<i>ju</i>!</b>

15:47.231 --> 15:48.691
<b>Did you say something?</b>

15:49.661 --> 15:52.411
<b>Do as Nami-<i>san</i> says!</b>

15:58.801 --> 16:03.781
<b>Our targets are right there!
Take them down!</b>

16:03.781 --> 16:06.991
<b>Yeah!</b>

16:08.181 --> 16:09.971
<b>Look behind us! Enemies!</b>

16:11.621 --> 16:12.911
<b>Charge!</b>

16:12.911 --> 16:15.501
<b>Yeah!</b>

16:16.101 --> 16:17.841
<b>Go faster, Kingbaum!</b>

16:17.841 --> 16:19.751
<b>I'm going as fast as I can-<i>ju</i>!</b>

16:19.751 --> 16:22.501
<b>If you get caught, I'll rip that seam!</b>

16:22.501 --> 16:23.881
<b>You're terrible!</b>

16:28.451 --> 16:30.261
<b>Something passed over our heads!</b>

16:33.461 --> 16:35.391
<b>--That voice...
--No way!</b>

16:38.791 --> 16:40.481
<b>What?!</b>

16:41.041 --> 16:47.641
<b>Wedding cake!</b>

16:48.471 --> 16:51.291
<b>Big Mom!</b>

16:55.121 --> 16:56.921
<b>Give it to me!</b>

17:11.831 --> 17:16.211
<b>GERMA KINGDOM</b>

17:19.621 --> 17:21.821
<b>Take them down!</b>

17:33.381 --> 17:37.761
<b>The Clone Soldiers are created to be
fighters who don't fear death.</b>

17:38.681 --> 17:45.151
<b>We, the Big Mom Pirates, will
take that military power over!</b>

18:17.751 --> 18:22.861
<b>A room where they manufacture Clone Soldiers!
I found it!</b>

18:32.451 --> 18:36.121
<b>Humph! A throne without a king...</b>

18:36.991 --> 18:39.261
<b>It's so sad...</b>

18:39.621 --> 18:41.521
<b>Break it down immediately!</b>

18:42.251 --> 18:43.731
<b>There is a king.</b>

18:46.321 --> 18:47.321
<b>You're...</b>

19:00.701 --> 19:02.881
<b>Wh-What the hell?!</b>

19:03.131 --> 19:04.211
<b>Stealth!</b>

19:15.071 --> 19:20.431
<b>You guys aren't allowed beyond this point!
You bushy-haired freak!</b>

19:21.291 --> 19:24.271
<b>Burn! Burn! Burn!</b>

19:26.091 --> 19:27.571
<b>Burn to ashes!</b>

19:38.311 --> 19:40.931
<b>Don't push your luck!</b>

19:42.521 --> 19:46.841
<b>Thank you for doing whatever you like
in our kingdom!</b>

19:47.301 --> 19:48.801
<b>Oh, no...</b>

20:06.331 --> 20:10.031
<b>How dare you make a fool of us!</b>

20:10.031 --> 20:15.201
<b>The Big Mom Pirates!
You bastards are totally unforgivable!</b>

20:16.431 --> 20:19.621
<b>We'll pay you back with interest.</b>

20:28.791 --> 20:30.091
<b>Big Mom!</b>

20:32.591 --> 20:34.821
<b>Luffy, control yourself!</b>

20:34.821 --> 20:37.091
<b>--Shut up!
--No!</b>

20:37.091 --> 20:39.221
<b>Let go of me, Jimbei!</b>

20:39.221 --> 20:45.061
<b>Going back to the Sunny is our objective!
Don't forget!</b>

20:50.541 --> 20:53.321
<b>Big Mom is nearing!</b>

20:54.321 --> 20:56.071
<b>What brings Mama to the front line?!</b>

20:56.071 --> 20:58.531
<b>And look at her...
She doesn't seem like herself!</b>

20:58.981 --> 21:00.991
<b>Don't tell me it's her Hunger Pangs!</b>

21:01.361 --> 21:05.201
<b>Wedding cake!</b>

21:05.201 --> 21:07.661
<b>Shake her off, Kingbaum!</b>

21:07.661 --> 21:09.421
<b>It's impossible-<i>ju</i>!</b>

21:09.421 --> 21:11.761
<b>--No, it's not!
--How can I do that?!</b>

21:11.761 --> 21:14.651
<b>--Run for yourself!
--Hey, Tree!</b>

21:16.011 --> 21:19.851
<b>Rush to the Sunny!</b>

21:40.841 --> 21:43.621
<b>Straw Hat!</b>

21:43.621 --> 21:46.121
<b>Give me the cake!</b>

21:46.811 --> 21:49.961
<b>Shut up!
I don't know what you're talking about!</b>

21:51.001 --> 21:52.911
<b>My...</b>

21:53.091 --> 21:58.131
<b>...cake!!</b>

21:59.841 --> 22:01.551
<b>Hang on, Kingbaum!</b>

22:06.951 --> 22:11.061
<b>Take the Spear of Elbaph!</b>

22:11.061 --> 22:12.361
<b>Elbaph?!</b>

22:16.631 --> 22:18.011
<b>Look out for her attack!</b>

22:30.171 --> 22:33.461
<b>Ikoku Sovereignty!</b>

23:09.741 --> 23:14.031
<b><i><i>Big Mom flying at their back!
The Seducing Woods before them!</i></i></b>

23:14.031 --> 23:15.781
<b><i><i>With the pressure on in 
this no-win situation,</i></i></b>

23:15.781 --> 23:18.911
<b><i>Nami hatches a scheme to find a way out!</i></b>

23:18.911 --> 23:22.181
<b><i><i>Meanwhile, a single tear 
glistens in Pudding's eye.</i></i></b>

23:22.181 --> 23:23.841
<b><i>But is it real or fake?</i></b>

23:23.841 --> 23:26.181
<b><i>Her true thoughts are revealed!</i></b>

23:26.181 --> 23:27.641
<b>On the next episode of One Piece!</b>

23:27.641 --> 23:30.551
<b>"Pudding's Determination! 
Ablaze! The Seducing Woods!"</b>

23:30.551 --> 23:32.951
<b>I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!</b>
